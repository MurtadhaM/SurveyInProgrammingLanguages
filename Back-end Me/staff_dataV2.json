As Carmen, Babcock made her French debut with the Festival Lyrique-en-Mer and has performed the role with companies such as Florentine Opera, Nashville Opera, Florida Grand Opera, New York City Opera, San Antonio Opera, Knoxville Opera, Opera Delaware, Toledo Opera, Anchorage Opera,Dayton Opera,Fort Worth Opera, Mill City Summer Opera, and Utah Festival Opera and most recently with Bar Harbor Music Festival where she completed her 115th performance of the fiercest of the Femme Fatales.    Babcock discerns her research focuses along two tracts; the physical mechanisms of the breathing apparatus as pertains to the act of singing and specific arenas of musical history. To the singing mechanism, Ms. Babcock\u2019s research pertains to the pelvic floor, pelvic health, and its tangible use in partnership with the deconstruction of breath. She is unpacking the relationship of the pelvic diaphragm to the global singing instrument from laryngeal stabilization to simultaneous neurological calm and full-bodied sonic vitality. Embodying these tools, Babcock\u2019s Masterclass series,The Full-Bodied Voice, has brought her to colleges and Young Artist programs across the US and abroad from Fort Worth Opera to California Institute of the Arts. The series, from inspiration to creation, directly addresses how life and society has retrained the perfect breath we were born to take. From the ancient traditions of Kundalini Yoga and other kinesthetic practices shetakes these tools from practice to performance. Babcock\u2019s other arena of research involves bringing historical music and language into a modern context investigating Sephardic music, the Ladino language, and music created prior to and through the diaspora (post expulsion from Spain). The cross-pollination of Arabic (Moorish), Catholic, and Jewish art and culture in Spain circa 1400 A.D., as well as the following aurally transmitted diasporic song tradition, are her specific focuses. Having spent much time under the tutelage of the late Nico Castel (who wrote the first book of ladino songs widely available to the public), her first album,Songs for Carmen, was born.SFC, a concept album, recorded under her Hebrew name,Aviva, hinges on the legend that the original Carmen may have been a Sephardic Jew and not a Gypsy. Babcock\u2019s concert series,Beyond Carmen, her work with the ensembleFlamenco Sepharditand her Choreopoem \u2013Carmen; Shadow of my Shadow, are all beneficiaries and extensions of this life-long pursuit.

She subsequently worked as a bioinformatics analyst and programmer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. In 1999, she took a faculty position at Virginia Tech and was involved in the development of their Bioinformatics graduate programs and the initial formation of the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute. In 2005, she moved to UNC Charlotte. Her expertise is in genomic data analysis, visualization and integration with experience in analysis of next-gen sequencing data, genome assembly, comparative genomics, transcriptomics, molecular biophysics, and molecular modeling. Google Scholar Profile Research Description: Dr. Gibas\u2019 current research is focused on development of automated methods for probe and target selection and microarray data analysis. Her research group is developing analytical methods that will take into account the biophysical properties of molecules involved in the array experiment. This work attempts to connect the real physical behavior of molecules to microarray experiment outcomes, and to eliminate confounding factors based on accurate models of molecular behavior. Microarrays are now so commonly used that providing new methods and standards for their use impacts broadly across many fields of molecular biology research. Long oligonucleotide microarrays the class of arrays that we are studying, are increasingly commonly used, and yet it is not known whether the parameters used to model hybridization reactions are valid in the microarray context. Complete hybridization of each target molecule to its intended probe is taken for granted, in a milieu where many competing binding scenarios may be equally valid. Dr. Gibas\u2019 major funding is from the NIH; the project is titled Biophysical Optimization of Oligonucleotide Microarrays\u201d. Dr. Gibas\u2019 other research interests include development of devices for measuring hybridization in real time, application of visual analytics approaches to comparative genomics, and development of accurate molecular diagnostics.

Professor Gero is an international consultant in the fields of design theory, computer-aided design, artificial intelligence in design and technology policy. His clients have included Xerox-PARC, IBM, US National Science Board, and Wells Fargo Bank. He holds multiple software licenses. Research Description: Dr Gero\u2019s research is based on the notion that designing is itself a meta-discipline practiced in multiple disciplines such as software design, hardware design, engineering, architecture, and industrial design. His research in design as a meta-discipline commenced with the development of models informed by the formal languages of optimization, artificial intelligence and computational constructs. The validation and simulation of these models has been advanced by cognitive studies of designers across multiple disciplines and has led to an integrated approach of design computing and design cognition. His current research focuses on computational creativity, situated computation, computational social science and the cognitive effects and outcomes of education, practice and experience. Current and recent research funding has come from the NSF (CMMI, CNS, EEC, IIS and SBE Programs), DARPA and NASA.

School Mathematics Research Interests:  My research and teaching focus on supporting pre-service and in-service teachers design and implementation of learner-centered tasks. My work explores how teacher education and professional development programs can most effectively support teachers\u2019 efforts to integrate technology and learner-centered tasks into their classroom.  Projects: Current Projects: Assessment Practices to Support Mathematics Learning and Understanding for Students (APLUS) A state-wide Mathematics Science Partnership project funded by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. The grant involves 6 school districts and provides professional development about mathematics formative assessment for teachers in Grades Kindergarten through Grade 2. Exploring Mathematical Tasks This project focuses on exploring how teachers design, implement, and modify mathematical tasks in their classrooms. This project focuses on the interplay between mathematical tasks and student understanding. Technology Integration in Mathematics This project focuses on exploring how teachers integrate technology in their mathematics teaching. The focus is on the interplay between technologies, mathematical tasks, teachers\u2019 actions, and student understanding.

Evidence supports operationalizing effective practice and knowledge in terms of observable teacher-student interactions. We can improve teacher-student interactions by providing teachers with explicit evaluations, feedback, and training. However, teacher improvement efforts must be supported by reliable, valid measurement and rigorous research designs. In my research program, I seek to 1) measure teachers\u2019 practice of effective teacher-student interactions through observations that are reliable and valid, 2) measure teachers\u2019 knowledge of effective interactions related to observed teacher practice and to student outcomes, and 3) identify processes that improve teachers\u2019 practice and knowledge of effective teacher-student interactions in school contexts.

Research Statement: Dr. Howden\u2019s research program focuses on genetic control of cardiopulmonary function at baseline and under specific environmental conditions. Further, Dr. Howden is investigating the mechanisms associated with isometric exercise training induced reductions in human resting blood pressure. Baseline cardiopulmonary function Little is known about the likely complex nature of the genetic influence on cardiopulmonary control. Dr. Howden has developed a model for assessing baseline cardiopulmonary function from quiescent, unrestrained, conscious mice. In this model, electrocardiographic (ECG) is recorded by radio telemetry and pulmonary function by whole body plethysmgraphy, simultaneously. Coupling this animal model with available genetic tools, Dr. Howden has identified a number of potential candidate genes. We have identified a region (QTL) on mouse chromosome 6 that associates with between mouse strain differences in baseline heart rate (Figure 1). We are currently investigating the genetic effect of this QTL on baseline heart rate.   Figure 1. Genome-wide linkage map for baseline heart rate in 28 AXB/BXA RI strains. The X axis represents the length of the each chromosome, the left Y axis shows the Likelihood Odds Ratio. (LOD; blue line), and the right Y axis shows the degree to which either A/J (green line) or B6 (red line; parental strains) alleles increase phenotypic values. The numbers along the top of the graph indicate chromosome number. The lower horizontal line indicates suggestive linkage and the upper horizontal line indicates significant (P < 0.05) linkage. Adapted from Howden et al. (2008) Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 295(1), H59 \u2013 68. Hyperoxia-induced cardiopulmonary responses Prolonged hyperoxia (100% oxygen) exposure is an established animal model for Acute Lung Injury, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Bronchpulmonary Dysplasia. However, little is known about the role of the cardiovascular system in the adverse outcomes associated with these diseases. Using similar tools to those described above, continuous cardiopulmonary function can be recorded during hyperoxia exposure of genetic reference animal populations to describe the genetic contribution to exposure-induced responses. We have identified a region (QTL) on mouse chromosome 9 that associates with between mouse strain differences in heart rate responses to hyperoxia exposure (Figure 2). We are currently investigating the genetic effect of this QTL on baseline heart rate.  Figure 2. Genome-wide linkage map for heart rate responses to hyperoxia exposure in 28 AXB/BXA RI strains.

(epub ahead of print)  Isometric exercise training induced reductions in blood pressure  In recent years, low volume isometric exercise training it has been shown constituently to induce a reduction in human resting blood pressure (Figure 3). Since the exercise training is simple to perform, this paradigm could have important clinical implicates. However, little is known about the mechanisms associated with these changes in blood pressure, an understanding of which could provide the basis for maximizing the therapeutic benefit of isometric exercise training.

Impaired skeletal muscle regeneration is one component of sarcopenia. Notch and Wnt signaling are suggested to be dysfunctional during regeneration of aged skeletal muscle. It is of interest to determine the effect of models of biological muscle injury (physiological stimuli) on Notch and Wnt signaling during aged skeletal muscle repair. Dr. Arthur\u2019s research agenda consists of examining the influence of Notch and Wnt signaling during repair of aged skeletal muscle that was exposed to physiological stimuli (exercise, muscle lengthening, hypertrophy). In addition, Dr. Arthur is investigating the interaction of Notch and Wnt signaling with muscle proteins that may be important for myogenesis (Msx1 Foxk1). In a collaboration with Appalachian State (Kevin Zwetsloot and Andy Shanely) Dr. Arthur and their team are studing the effect of the naturally-produced phytoecdysteroids from Ajuga turkestanica as a countermeasure against sarcopenia. Dr. Arthur is collaborating with colleagues at UNC Charlotte, Drs.

I have realized that the development of healthy lifestyles often begins at infancy and continues through the stages of life (i.e. infancy, childhood, adolescence, early adulthood, adulthood, and older adult), thus it is crucial to understand health differences across the lifespan. In an attempt to better explain the multiple determinants associated with a specific condition, my research agenda integrates a life course approach to the study of chronic diseases and contributes to the advancement of my expertise in the field. Several chronic conditions have been linked, in part, to fetal environment, which include the following: hypertension, type 2 diabetes, asthma, prostate cancer, obesity, cognition, and stroke.

I am an internationally recognized expert on active life expectancy, a central public health indicator that measures life expectancy and the proportions of life with and without disability or disease. The United States and countries throughout the world use active life expectancy to assess population health, and to develop and evaluate health policies. Researchers throughout the world use methods that I helped to develop to study active life expectancy, which use panel survey data combined with Markov models and microsimulation. Microsimulation creates simulated populations that mirror the characteristics of actual populations. With the simulated populations researchers can follow individuals and groups throughout life. This provides new knowledge about the dynamics of health and disability, as well as factors that may help to increase access to health care, address health disparities, and promote well-being. Microsimulation addresses complex research questions that cannot be studied effectively using more conventional methods. My current research examines life expectancy, active life expectancy, disability, chronic disease, and developmental disability using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID, 1968-present), the longest running household survey in the world. These data allow me to follow individuals through all life stages, and families both across households and through several generations. I have published more than 150 peer-reviewed research studies, and have mentored students as coauthors on more than half of those publications. My CV includes my publications. I am a Fellow of the Gerontological Society of America. I serve on the Editorial Boards of: Disability and Health Journal, Journal of Women & Aging, and Journals of Gerontology Social Sciences. My research has been funded by the National Institute on Aging, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Health Resources and Services Administration. I have substantial professional practice experience in both public health and the personal health care system. I have supervised numerous program evaluations for public health agencies, schools of medicine, and health care organizations. In academic leadership, I led Master of Health Administration (MHA) Programs, 2003 to 2011, as the MHA Program Director, mentored more than 650 graduate students of health administration, and led successful re-accreditation initiatives involving the Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Management Education (CAHME) at the University of South Carolina (2005) and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (2010). I have mentored more than 45 doctoral students in research. I received an A.B. from Colgate University, an A.A.S. (Registered Nursing), from SUNY Morrisville, a B.P.S. (Health Services Management) from SUNY Polytechnic Institute, an M.B.A. (Finance) from the Whitman School of Management at Syracuse University, and an M.A. (Economics) and a Ph.D. (Public Administration) from the Maxwell School at Syracuse University.

We join efforts with those working to eliminate cultural norms that permit and encourage an environment where sexual violence is rampant and unchecked.This includes strengtheningnorms that encourage individuals to regard sexual violence as a community issue that we all have responsibility to address, as well as encouraging individuals, families, and communities to aspire towards healthy, respectful relationships. Further we seek to build social work organizations with the necessary policies and practices to ensure workplaces free from retaliation, bullying, retribution, and other misuses of power and control. We commit to conduct research that affirms survivors\u2019 experiences and acknowledges the role of social stigma, societal structures, and systemic oppression. We view sexual violence from an intersectional perspective and understand that members of marginalized groups have higher rates and bear disproportionate burden of sexual violence, including (but not limited to) those living in poverty, individuals with disabilities, immigrants, and racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minorities. We value research that provides evidence toeffectively estimate, prevent, recognize and respondto sexual violence. We also advocate for research to helpdetermine best strategies for working with individuals who perpetrate sexual violence. In addition, we commit to doing all we can to assure our students and colleagues have educational and professional experiences that are safe, affirming, and free from sexual violence.

Her doctoral training is in public health gerontology. Her research focuses on the areas of health disparities, aging, and psychosocial influences on health.  The intersection of these 3 foci comprise the area of primary and secondary prevention of chronic disease. She works in the the broader of fields of physical activity, nutrition, tobacco, weight management, alcohol and medication adherence within the context of preventing and managing chronic disease. Her primary interest is improving chronic illness self-care and disease management in African Americans. Minority groups often experience excess morbidity, disability and mortality from chronic illness conditions. African Americans in particular often experience onset of chronic disease much earlier than Whites and thus are required to manage these chronic diseases for decades. This chronic disease burden can result in accelerated aging and a cumulative health disadvantage. More effective chronic disease self-management would potentially reduce the health disparities experienced by minority groups. Her research provides a basis for developing more culturally acceptable interventions to improve African Americans\u2019 chronic illness self-care practices. Dr. Warren-Findlow\u2019s research uses qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate the influences of social determinants on chronic disease self-care. Her primary emphasis is on scale development and measurement of self-care behaviors related to cardiovascular disease. She has developed the Hypertension Self-care Activity Level Effects (H-SCALE) to assess the 6 recommended behaviors for managing high blood pressure. Dr. Warren-Findlow\u2019s work is directly related to helping achieve the Healthy People 2020 goals of extending years of healthy life and reducing racial and ethnic health disparities.

My interdisciplinary research looks at issues of consciousness, culture and identity in micro-mobilization processes among members of the African Diaspora, especially late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century enslaved people\u2019s rebellions. I specifically focus on the influence of African-inspired sacred rituals on oppositional consciousness and patterns of escape from enslavement before the Haitian Revolution. I rely heavily on archival data, including content analysis of digitally archived runaway slave advertisements. These allow me to ask questions about the role of race and ethnicity, gender, social ties, and forms of human and social capital used in runaways\u2019 attempts to liberate themselves. My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the John Carter Brown Library, as well as the African American Intellectual History Society.

She specializes in applied and medical anthropology. She also has an MPH in global public health. She has worked in Latin America, Africa, and South Florida. Her research has looked at the rise of grassroots transnational organizations targeting aid to orphans in Malawi, southern Africa. She explores the emerging global connections among volunteers, donors, development workers, program organizers and the directors associated with these organizations and the children they serve. She has also worked on projects that included an examination of risky sexual behavior between female long term tourists and local men in Monteverde, Costa Rica, farmworker experiences with eye injury and access to medical care in Immokalee, Florida, and community experiences with evacuation and relocation in and around Mount Tungurahua in Ecuador.

Currently I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am concerned with the social and interactional production of difference, particularly in Oceania and the Pacific diaspora. My book,Talking Like Children: Language and the Production of Age in the Marshall Islands (Oxford University Press 2019) applies the significant advances in cultural and linguistic analyses of well-discussed forms of social differentiation\u2014such as gender and race\u2014to the relatively overlooked category of age. I argue that immaturity is cultural, not natural, and that Marshallese children are socialized to be different from their elders. I also show how a basic and central issue in anthropological theory and ethnography\u2014exchange in Oceania\u2014cannot be understood without attention to the life-course or children\u2014 revealing the relevance of age to anthropological theory. In both the book and several other publications, I apply my findings on interaction, age, and difference to the analysis of economics and exchange, kinship and adoption, and humanitarian campaigns to end corporal punishment. I am beginning a new project on language, age, and race in the Marshallese diaspora, and specifically in Springdale, Arkansas. This project asks (1) How are distinct Marshallese linguistic and cultural practices interpretedand transformed in school? and (2) What effect do these interactions have on Marshallese diasporaidentity?

Welcome to my faculty webpage. Here you\u2019ll get to know me as a professor by perusing the site to find information on the research I\u2019ve done as well as information on current projects and classes I teach. In addition you\u2019ll find helpful links to relevant information and videos. INTERACTIVE LEARNING and SCIENCE EDUCATION: My passion is teaching science through interactive learning. I teach biology to both majors and non-majors and aim to integrate both creativity and practicality. I write songs and poems about class material to entice and enhance interest. I also integrate Practical Biology\u201d and Wildwood Wisdom\u201d sections to inform students of the application of concepts they are learning in class. I strive to make learning as interactive as possible by creating a multitude of in-class activities and facilitating continuing group work. I use as many tools as possible including eLearning suites such as Canvas and SymBio as well as in class transmission software such as Poll Everywhere to further improve interaction among students. Field Ecology \u2013 in the field and in the lab: I teach field ecology and coordinate the ecology labs. Field ecology\u2019s main goal is to provide students with an understanding of their local ecosystem using modern sampling methods. Wildlife biologists, zoologists, conservation biologists, ecologists, botanists, dendrologists, marine biologists, agronomists, entomologists, ornithologists, biological science technicians, park rangers,veterinarians and even curators of natural science museums often develop their first practical field skill set in field ecology and ecology lab. Due to this it is often an extremely exciting and challenging experience. I do my best to pique student interest and provide them with the skill set necessary to begin one of many career options in the world of natural sciences. Principles and General Biology: Principles of Biology is an integral part of many majors\u2019 undergraduate careers including nursing, psychology, and education majors. In addition, it is often the class where many students decide they want to study biology for the long term. As a non-majors biology class it is extremely challenging and creativity in teaching methods is a necessity to maintain interest in a course that covers all aspects biological life and how it functions. Click here for a sample song I sing to my classes about mitosis. I also teach the introductory course sequence (2120 and 2130) of biology for majors. As these courses are often grueling in detail I make each lecture thematic to best capture students attention. We don\u2019t study the respiratory system, we learn how Freedivers manipulate it. We don\u2019t study animal development, we learn why Heptapods are the perfect aliens. I also teach students a number of Mnemonic systems in these classes that they can use to maximize their memorization abilities throughout their collegiate career. PROJECTS Arbor 49er: Arbor 49er was created to optimize student interaction with their local ecosystem while simultaneously enhancing the skill set of ecology students. Many universities have representative tree species labeled throughout campus and are even nationally recognized arboretums. In an effort to put UNCC\u2019s trees on the map\u201d so to speak I created the initiative termed Arbor 49er. 49 representative tree species on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte were selected by myself and students in my Fall 2012 Ecology Lab. Pictures of the species were taken and exported to the appropriate cartographic locations in Google Earth. Demographic data were gathered on the trees and descriptions were written for each tree species. Thus, an interactive map was created. For more information on the evolution and collaboration of this project click the Arbor 49er tab above. Downloadable Google Earth files can be assessed via the Arbor 49er tab in either fully descriptive or mystery tree hunt form as well. A hard copy brochure is available and permanent brass signs are now in place! Piedmont Diving Rescue Association: As the Environmental Quality Research Officer for the North Carolina Piedmont Diving Association (PDRA), I monitor water quality and overall ecological health of a number of local quarries. These quarries are used for both recreational and rescue dive training. They are also a unique learning environment as they provide an opportunity for students to conduct studies outside of the campus ecological reserve.Together with the PDRA my students and I aim to maintain the health of these quarries semester after semester. RESEARCH Barred Owls: Who cooks for you! Who cooks for you too!\u201d goes the often phrased Barred Owl call. The first research I conducted was alongside Dr. Richard Bierregaard and involved studying the local Barred Owl (Strix varia) population in its suburban habitat. The focus of this study was South Charlotte. I built traps, radio tagged, and then telemetry tracked the owls at night. Pretty scary, huh? These locations were then registered in Google Earth for later use in demographic study. We built owl boxes to encourage nesting and installed nest cams to monitor prey delivery as well. You wouldn\u2019t believe what Barred Owls eat! For more information on this awesome study click the Barred Owl tab above. American Bullfrogs: To us, the American Bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) is quite harmless. However, believe it or not, among amphibians they\u2019re tough guys and dangerous predators. They\u2019ve been known to eat small birds and even each other! For my graduate studies, with Dr. Sue Peters, I investigated the role of testosterone on the musculature involved in grappling and amplexus (bullfrogs mating embrace). In a world with increasing pollution, natural waterways are easily susceptible to destruction. Amphibians are classic indicators of ecological health and relevant research conducted in relation to their evolutionary adaptations is invaluable for their conservation.

As a member of mylab each student should achieve masteryof new biological lab techniques, an intellectual understanding of research questions and literature, and a feeling ofcollaboration and camaraderie through active learning.The lab team experiencepromotes success of both the students and the projects. Graduate and undergraduate students in my lab are expected to participate inresearchprojects as part of a team. No studentis singularly responsible for her/his ownpersonal project. Students help each other get experiments finished, troubleshoot problems, and analyze results for posters and publications.New students get to learn from the more senior students; senior students in turn test their understanding of concepts and protocolsby teachingthe new.Publications include all members of the team further promotingcollaboration as well as a sense of accomplishment by everyone. Students are expected toparticipate in weekly lab research progress meetings, journal clubs, and joint meetings with other University lab collaborators.   RESEARCH INTERESTS AND CURRENT LAB PROJECTS DNA repair and genome stability in mitotic cells using mouse models Although the role of homologous recombination (HR) to repair DNA damage is well appreciated in meiosis of prokaryotes, yeast, and metazoans. However the role of interchromosomal HR (between TWO different chromosomes) to occur in vivo in many different types ofcells of mammals is only minimally understood. It is importantto understand when interchromosomal HR can occur because it has the potential maintaingenome stability, and also drive genetic diversity and evolution, or even genome rearrangements leading to cancer. Our laboratory established unique mouse models using green fluorescent protein reporters (GFP) to determine the potential of DNA damage to promote HRin vivo. These models were the first to demonstrate that interchromosomal HR occurs in vivo in multiple organ systems, and provide an ideal platform to further elucidate which cells at specific developmental stages of development or differentiation may be most likely to undergo this type of DSB repair. Ourresearchwill lead to an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of DSB rejoining at the chromosomal level, and also provide insight on genome stability and genetic evolution. DNA damage-induced chromosomal rearrangements in leukemia The long-term objective of this researchis to understand the mechanisms used by hematopoietic (blood) cells to repair of one type of DNA damage \u2014 the double-strand break (DSB)\u2013 and the initial molecular events that lead to genomic rearrangements such as translocations, which are a hallmark of leukemias. DNA damaging agents are common therapy in the treatment of human cancers, but they also produce chromosomal rearrangements and oncogenic transformation and tumor formation. Recent data from my lab indicates that chromosomal rearrangements analogous to those observed in hematopoietic malignancies are readily formed during DSB repair in both human and mouse hematopoietic stem cell-enriched populations. My lab uses multiple genetic approaches in cultured cell lines and genetically engineered mice to identify the initial events that promote the formation of DNA damage-induced chromosomal rearrangements, and the cooperative mutations or predisposing factors that can promote (or suppress) transformation of cells that acquire them. There is a growing list of compounds in our daily life that promote or stabilize chromosomal DSBs and may lead to these chromosomal rearrangements. These include dietary supplements and environmental toxins including estrogens used as hormone supplements, bioflavonoids such as genistein and quercetin found in foods, soy products energy drinks and dietary supplements, quinones or benzenes found in paints and flame retardants used in homes andfurniture.Our research will provide an understanding of which of these can produce genome changes that may lead to leukemia and also determine if exposure in utero through maternal exposure may promote infant leukemia. tWe hope this researchmay lead to new approaches to prevention or therapy. Biomarkers of Ovarian Cancer Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is responsible for an estimated 21,800 new cases and 14,000 deaths each year. Overall, patients have a five-year survival rate of 30%-40%. The primary option of treatment is often invasive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and taxane (Paclitaxel) that lead to multiple systemic side effects and toxicity, limiting the doses physicians can use. Up to 80% of patients will eventually relapse and become platinum-taxane resistant. The overall goals of thisresearch are to (1) use genetic, genomic, and proteomic approaches to understand how altered proteins promote ovarian cancerand may act as biomarkers of susceptibility and disease, and (2) use knowledge about tumor specific characteristics or biomarkers to develop new targeted therapies.Our research used both bioinformatic approaches and proteomic approaches toidentifysignificant loss of HOXC6 in epithelial ovarian cancer in both the tumor itself and in the serum of patients with this cancer type. Archived Research : Targeted Nanoparticle-Aptamer Therapy of Ovarian Cancer Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is responsible for an estimated 21,800 new cases and 14,000 deaths each year. Overall, patients have a five-year survival rate of 30%-40%. The primary option of treatment is often invasive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and taxane (Paclitaxel) that lead to multiple systemic side effects and toxicity, limiting the doses physicians can use. Up to 80% of patients will eventually relapse and become platinum-taxane resistant. We identified single-stranded DNA aptamers a Cell-SELEX screen that we hypothesize will selectively associate with and internalize into ovarian cancercells but not other cells both in cultured cell lines and in a xenograft mouse model. Conjugation of the aptamers to polymer nanoparticles loaded with paclitaxel will be assessed for potential to promote in vivo targeting of platinum-based chemotherapeutics directly to tumor cells. In addition to potential translational outcomes, our studies will increase our understanding of the basic biologic characteristics of individual epithelial ovarian tumor cell membranes, aptamer association and internalization, and cellular response to aptamers and nanoparticles. This researchwill provide a significant new effective therapeutic approach to epithelial ovarian cancer treatment.

Awards  2014 Outstanding Faculty Award Multicultural Academic Service Award 2020 CLAS Excellence in Teaching: Integration of Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award  Research  The Research projects ongoing in Dr. Dr\u00e9au\u2019s laboratory focus on understanding the molecular, cellular, and physiological bases of metastases associated with cancers of epithelial origin. The cancers of epithelial origin include: the most lethal skin cancer, i.e. melanoma and the most common solid tumor in female i.e., breast cancer. In these cancers as in others, the occurrence of metastases is associated with a high mortality (see the site of the American Cancer Society for details on cancer statistics in the US: http://www.cancer.org) The development of metastases is a multi-step process, which, from the tumor standpoint, includes:  Development of tumor cells with metastatic potentials. Detachment, migration of tumor cells generally through the vascular system (blood, lymph vessels), and anchoring within the host tissue. Growth of the metastatic mass requiring the concurrent development of vessels, i.e. neo-angiogenesis, which provide oxygen and various nutriments. Preventing responses of the immune system throughout all the steps associated with the development of tumor metastases.    Dr. Dr\u00e9au\u2019s research centers on the mechanisms of cancer metastasis, and the vascular and immune interactions associated with cancer growth. More specifically, the following aspects of cancer metastasis are studied:  Key features of Metastatic Tumors Anchoring and Growth of Metastatic Tumors Vascularization of the Metastatic Tumors Interactions Immune System and Metastases; the role of inflammasommes in local inflammation  Research Opportunities:  Interested Graduate Students (either Ph.D. or M.S. students) should contact Dr. Didier Dr\u00e9au at: ddreau@uncc.edu For REU opportunities please check the REU Summer Program: Biology and Biotechnology at http://biology.uncc.edu/research/reu-biotechnology Interested Undergraduate Students (either Honors or BIOL3900 students) should contact Dr. Didier Dr\u00e9au at: ddreau@uncc.edu  Lab Members  Katherine Holtzman (PhD Candidate) Khanh Nguyen (PhD Candidate) Courtney Samuels (MS Student) Layla Abu Al Halaweh (Honors Student) Madison Snyder (Levine Scholar)  Lab Alumni  Postdoctoral Fellows  \u2013 Muthulekha Swamydas, PhD (2008-2010) \u2013 Danielle Van, PhD (2011-2012)  Graduate students  \u2013 Deepika Suryaprakash (MS Student, 2018).

My team employs both field-based and lab-based approaches to address important questions of how malaria infect and spread among humans. Contact me if you would like to be on-board and make a contribution to understanding and tackling malaria!   Global epidemiology of malaria  While countries such as China and Thailand in Southeast Asia are approaching malaria elimination, Africa is still home to 90% of malaria cases and 92% of malaria deaths. In 2016, an estimated $2.7 billion was funded for malaria control and elimination. Plasmodium falciparum is the most prominent malaria parasite in Africa and is responsible for most malaria-related deaths globally. Other parasite species including P. vivax, P. ovale, andP. malariae are also observed in Africa, SE Asia, and South America. The fifth malaria parasite speciesP. knowlesi is only known to occur in SE Asia. Recently, P. simium has been confirmed in Brazil that switches from a monkey reservoir to human beings causing malaria.

As such, NK-1R antagonists have been subjected to extensive research for use in the treatment of a variety of disease conditions, and several of these agents have recently been introduced clinically to prevent nausea and vomiting. Importantly, our laboratory has assembled a compelling body of evidence indicating that substance P/NK-1R interactions exacerbate inflammation at mucosal sites and within the CNS. In addition to its effects on leukocytes, we have demonstrated that substance P exacerbates the inflammatory responses of resident brain cells including microglia and astrocytes to clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. Furthermore, we have also shown that endogenous substance P/NK-1R interactions are required for maximal inflammation and CNS damage in murine models of meningitis. Interestingly, our data indicate that prophylactic or therapeutic systemic administration of an NK-1R antagonist can markedly attenuate bacterially-induced neuroinflammation in animal models. As such, these data suggest that the NK-1R may represent an important new target in the treatment of potentially lethal CNS inflammation.

Human microglia and astrocytes constitutively express the neurokinin-1 receptor and functionally respond to substance P.  Neuroinflamm. 14: 245.   Glia utilize cell surface and cytosolic innate immune receptors to recognize microbial and viral pathogens  Glial cells such as microglia and astrocytes are increasingly recognized to play a critical role in the initiation, progression, and/or maintenance of inflammatory host responses to CNS pathogens. Our laboratory has been at the forefront in the study of the mechanisms by which these cells perceive viral and bacterial pathogens. The innate immune system recognizes a wide spectrum of pathogens without the need for prior exposure and the identification of highly conserved families of proteins that serve as microbial pattern recognition receptors including the Toll-like (TLR), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like (NLR), and retinoic acid inducible gene-I-like (RLR) receptors has shed light on the mechanisms by which this is accomplished. These microbial sensors precipitate the production of inflammatory cytokines and antiviral type I interferons. Hence, activation of cells in this manner can initiate the repertoire of defense mechanisms used by the innate immune system. We have shown that microglia and astrocytes express cell surface TLRs and use cytosolic sensors for the detection of intracellular pathogens that include NOD2, an intracellular receptor for bacterial peptidoglycans, and two members of the RLR family, RIG-I and MDA5, that serve as cytosolic sensors for replicative RNA viruses. Furthermore, we have subsequently described the expression of two cytosolic sensors for double-stranded DNA by glia, DNA-dependent activator of interferon-regulatory factors (DAI) and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), suggesting that these novel sensors might play a critical role in the detection of replicative DNA viruses by CNS cells.

Vibrio vulnificus  First described in 1976, Vibrio vulnificus is a halophilic bacterial species that causes primary septicemia and wound infections (Fig. 1). Disease in humans results from contamination of a skin lesion or ingestion of contaminated seafood. A striking feature is that many victims die with a few hours of symptom development) and the high mortality rate (>50% and 25%, respectively). The infectious dose of V. vulnificus is believed to be low and fatal infections have been reported after the ingestion of a single oyster (the primary source in 93% of all cases). Fatal wound infections acquired by contamination of ant bite lesions have also been reported. Between 1989 and 2008, 520 ingestion cases with 263 deaths (51%) were reported. Most cases (>85%) occur in males over the age of 40 (Fig. 2), as estrogen appears to block the endotoxin produced by this species.This is an opportunistic pathogen, with infections largely restricted (>95% of cases) to those having underlying liver diseases (such as liver cirrhosis or hepatitis). Three biotypes of V. vulnificus exist, and among biotype 1, the primary type in human infections, several very distinct genotypes are known to occur. One area of our study involves these genotypes. The C-genotype\u201d correlates strongly with a clinical origin, and these strains appear to be highly virulent. In contrast, the E-genotype\u201d correlates with isolation from the environment, and appears to be of lower virulence. At the DNA level, the two genotypes differ significantly from each other (some genes differ in >30% of their sequence), yet the two genotypes are highly similar within the genotype (Fig. 3). One enigma we are investigating is a result of our observation that, while the distribution of the two genotypes in estuarine waters appears to be approximately equal (Fig. 4), the oysters that inhabit those waters carry a high proportion (ca 85:15) of the E-genotype.

Path. Dis. Doi:10.1093/femspd/ftv072  Bacterial Stress Responses Many of the so-called heat shock proteins, such as chaperone proteins (e.g. DnaK and GroEL) and proteases (e.g. Clp, Lon), are also induced by other environmental changes, such as high osmolarity, nutrient starvation, exposure to low temperature, the presence of heavy metals, oxidative agents or pollutants, and interaction with eukaryotic hosts.Therefore, the heat shock response can more accurately be considered a general stress response.Through a process termed cross protection, this response improves tolerance to otherwise lethal temperatures, high or low salt levels, heavy metals, UV exposure, and starvation, and plays a critical role in bacterial pathogenesis.Such stress responses are critical forbacterial adaptation to the constant changes in the environment experienced by estuarine bacteria, such as most Vibrio spp., and are therefore a major link between microbial ecology, physiology, and microbial pathogenesis.One example is the htrA system, the product of which is essential for bacterial growth only at elevated (e.g. human body) temperatures. This system is activated by the alternate sigma factor, sE, encoded by the rpoE gene.This gene has been shown to control mucoidy in cystic fibrosis isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.In E. coli, transcriptional activation of the heat shock genes is induced by the alternate sigma factor, s32 (product of the rpoH gene). Our lab is interested in the bacterial response to a variety of environmental stresses, especially starvation, low temperature, high salinity (osmotic stress), and oxidative (e.g. peroxide) stress.The bacterium under greatest investigation I this lab is V. vulnificus. We study the mechanisms by which this pathogen survives in the estuarine environment, the molecular regulatory mechanisms which occur during these survival responses. Of special interest in this regard is the use of membrane diffusion chambers to examine in situ gene expression by cells in their natural aquatic environment.

Microbiol. 78:3885-3889.  The Viable but Nonculturable State Microbial ecologists have long recognized that large proportions of the microbial populations inhabiting natural habitats appear to be nonculturable.Indeed, plate counts of bacteria in soil, rivers and oceans typically indicate that far less than 1% of the total bacteria observed by direct microscopic examination can be grown on culture media. Further, it has also long been known that certain portions of bacterial populations in natural environments seem to disappear during certain seasons, only to reappear at other times. We now understand that at least part of the explanation for these observations is not due to seasonal die-off of the cells, but to their entry into a physiological state most commonly called the viable but nonculturable\u201d state. A bacterial cell in the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state may be defined as one which fails to grow on the routine bacteriological media on which it would normally grow and develop into a colony, but which is in fact alive and metabolically active.Bacteria enter into this dormant state in response to one or more environmental stresses which might otherwise be lethal to the cell.Thus, the VBNC state should be considered a means of cell survival.Eventually, when the inducing stress is removed, these cells are able to emerge from the VBNC state and again become culturable on routine media. The typical VBNC response is seen in this figure, which shows the response of Vibrio vulnificus to exposure to low temperature (5oC). Such a temperature is below that at which this aquatic bacterium can grow and, if it were not for the VBNC response, is a temperature which would eventually lead to death of the population. VBNC cells lose their ability to be cultured in a rather linear manner, eventually reaching a point where plate counts suggest a total lack of any living cells.However, whereas death of a bacterial population generally leads to lysis of the cells and loss of cell structure, direct examination of cells entering the VBNC state indicates that the cells remain intact. Such cells could, of course, have died, but simply not undergone lysis.The primary evidence that such cells are alive, even if nonculturable, is from data obtained when a direct viability\u201d assay is applied to such cultures, or continued production of mRNA is detected.Such assays allow direct determination of individual cell viability, without the need for culture. Such assays generally indicate that a large portion of the apparently dead population is, in fact, alive. Cells entering the VBNC state generally undergo a reduction in size, and during this time, significant changes in membrane structure, protein composition, ribosomal content, and possibly even DNA arrangement are experienced.However, decreases macromolecular synthesis do not mean that all synthesis has ceased. Indeed, protein synthesis appears to be essential for entry into this state, and under these conditions V. vulnificus produces some 40 new proteins not seen during growth at normal\u201d temperatures.At the same time, dramatic decreases in membrane fatty acid composition, and in nutrient transport and respiration rates, have generally been reported to occur as cells enter this dormant state. Cell wall synthesis, or at least metabolism of the constituents of these structures, also apparently continues. Some of our most recent studies indicate that quorum sensing plays a significant role in resuscitation of cells from the VBNC state, signaling to dormant cells that conditions are good, and growth is now permissive.

Hepatic blood flow, particularly sinusoidal flow perfusion is essential for normal functions and metabolism of hepatocytes and also plays a crucial role in repair of injured cells in liver diseases. Regulation of sinusoidal blood perfusion consists of a delicate balance between the vasoconstrictor force and the vasodilator force that involve close interactions among the sinusoidal cells (i.e., endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells) and hepatocytes. The primary interest of this laboratory is to delineate the relationship between the sinusoidal cells and hepatocytes with respect to their interaction contributing to the regulation of constrictor and dilator forces in various stress conditions such as endotoxemic shock, hemorrhagic shock, liver cirrhosis and liver transplant. We recently discovered, for example, that endothelin, a locally released vasoconstrictor by endothelial cells and perhaps more importantly by hepatocytes under certain diseases, induces sinusoidal constriction by contracting hepatic stellate cells thus reducing sinusoidal perfusion, and this effect is opposed by vasodilators nitric oxide and carbon monoxide. Our primary goal is to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the balance of local constrictor and dilator forces in a variety of disease conditions and ultimately find drug interventions that help maintain liver perfusion under the stress conditions and rectify the injured tissue.

The DNA repair pathway is exceptionally important to prevent DNA breaks during normal replication and to remove DNA lesions after damage has occurred. Defects in combinations of DNA repair genes represent a double-edged sword that either enhances cell sensitivity or generates resistance to DNA damage agents, as in some cancers. Influence of FAM35A on end resection: During DNA replication, exposure to chemotherapy drugs such as camptothecin or PARP inhibitors can block replication forks, sometimes producing a one-ended double-strand break (DSB). FAM35A, in concert with REV7, RIF1, 53BP1, and other proteins, is proposed to be involved in suppressing the resection at a DSB that produces 3\u2019 single-stranded DNA. BRCA1-negative cells are unable to counter the inhibition mediated by this protein complex, resulting in cell death. In FAM35A-defective cells, 5\u2019 end resection can occur even in BRCA1 mutants, activating homologous recombination. This may be one mechanism of acquiring resistance to PARP inhibitor in BRCA1-mutant cells. However, excessive end resection can block the action of NHEJ. As an OB-fold protein, FAM35A may interact with single-stranded DNA and then block nucleases or interactions with other proteins. Our laboratory is working to define mechanisms of chemoresistance in prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers using approaches in biochemistry, protein complex (my favorite experiment), cell and molecular biology supplemented by newly available genome sequencing data (e.g. TCGA and ONCOMINE).

My current research investigates the innate immune response of neurons and the impact of microglia in recovery from WNV neurotropic infection. Cognitive dysfunction is a well-documented correlate of viral encephalitis; however the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear, in part due to lack of murine recovery models. To study the mechanisms of recovery from viral encephalitis, I use a murine model of intracranial infection with an attenuated strain of West Nile virus (WNV). My overarching hypothesis is that viral encephalitis incites inflammation that accelerates processes of CNS aging, contributing to the development of AD pathology and neurodegeneration.    Research in my laboratory uses the WNV encephalitis model to investigate I) how neuroinflammation alters genetic and synaptic programs, which affect and denote aging processes, II) how aging affects microglial response to inflammatory events, altering neuroinflammatory signatures, and III) how neuroinflammatory events affect pathological Tau accumulation, a well-studied correlate of neurodegeneration.

Multicellular eukaryotes (animals and plants) are familiar to everyone.However, these groups form only a few branches in the amazing evolutionary tree of eukaryotic diversity. The other eukaryotes are mostly microscopic, single-celled organisms commonly called algae, protists or microbial eukaryotes. They occur in all ecosystems and exert profound effects onthe planet and all life, ranging from economically and environmentally-destructive Harmful Algal Blooms to forming the base of the marine food web and providing the majority of oxygen to the biosphere.   Research in my laboratory focuses on the ecology, diversity and evolution of microbial eukaryotes. Specific topics include ecology of harmful algal blooms, biodiversity and evolution of protists, and use of algae and fungi in biotechnology such as biofuel production.

Tumor associated MUC1 plays a crucial role in progression of cancer by influencing cellular growth, transformation, adhesion, invasion, and immune surveillance. Tumor-associated MUC1 differs from the MUC1 expressed in normal cells with regard to its biochemical features, cellular distribution, and function. In cancer cells, MUC1 participates in intracellular signal transduction pathways and regulates the expression of its target genes at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Our Lab studies the functional differences that exist between normal and tumor-associated MUC1 using genomics and proteomics tools. Major focus is assessing tumor associated MUC1 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for cancer. Our lab is honored to recognize our benefactors for their commitment to strengthen cancer research at UNCC for the coming generations.

From a broader perspective, the DDR machinery plays important roles in fundamental biomedical fields, such as DNA replication, DNA damage repair, cell cycle regulation, transcription, apoptosis, senescence, and autophagy. Defective DDR pathways compromise genomic integrity, leading to human diseases. The research projects in the Yan lab focus on several essential questions linking DDR and human diseases, such as cancer, sepsis, aging, and neurodegenerative disorders. Using biochemical, molecular and cellbiology approaches, our laboratory is interested in crucial issues in maintaining genomic stability, including checkpointactivation, DNA damage repair, and translesion synthesis (TLS) in response to DNA replication stress and oxidative stress as well as other stressful conditions. Ultimately, our research program will help to better understand how cells maintaingenome stability and to provide novel clues for detection and treatment of human diseases.Xenopus egg extracts and mammalian cell lines will be used as model systems to investigate fundamental biomedical questions with cutting-edge technologies. One aim of this lab is to establish a motivated and productive research team. You are welcome to visit and/or join us!

A major emphasis in my lab is on the communication signals that regulate and adjust colony activities in response to changing conditions. Two communication signals are examined. First, we explore how the waggle dance is used to regulate colony-level foraging activity and movement. We use waggle dance activity to map spatial foraging patterns and determine how these patterns change with changing colony food needs. We also use the waggle dance to investigate movement patterns when colonies undergo reproductive swarming and seasonal migration. Second, we study the role of the vibration signal [in the video clip below, the bee with the tag Red 51 begins vibrating at 9 seconds].  https://pages.charlotte.edu/stan-schneider/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2012/02/R51-vibrator-audio-muted.wmv The vibration signal is one of the most commonly occurring communication signals in a colony and helps to regulate cooperative activities among workers. We have determined that the signal functions as a type of modulatory communication signal that causes a non-specific increase in activity. This, in turn, enhances many different behaviors, including foraging, brood care, food processing nest maintenance, swarming and house hunting. We have also found that workers use the vibration signal to influence queen behavior during colony reproduction, queen rearing and queen replacement. https://pages.charlotte.edu/stan-schneider/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2012/02/R51-vibrator-audio-muted.wmv [In the video clipabove, a worker vibrates a virgin queen at 1 s and then again at 12 s, immediately after which the queen performs piping]. The vibration signal may therefore play a major role in coordinating multiple colony activities.  A second emphasis in my lab is on the biology and behavior of the African honey bee, Apis mellifera scutellata. The African bee was introduced into South America in the 1950s and has become a major threat to beekeeping and agriculture in many parts of the Neotropics. Our work focuses on the nesting biology, foraging behavior, defensive behavior, swarming and migratory movements of the bee in both Africa and Latin America. We are determining the factors that have contributed to the rapid spread of the African bee in the new world. We also are examining if the behavior of the bee in Latin America differs from that in its native African environment. Most recently, we have begun to explore the survival and success of European-African hybrid colonies, because hybridization is at the heart of most programs designed to manage the African honey bee in the new world.

We are a new lab at theUniversity of North Carolina at Charlotte. The dinoflagellate in the family Symbiodiniaceae forms a symbiotic relationship with many hosts including coral, anemones, jellyfish, and clams. They provide coral with photosynthetically fixed carbon while the coral supplies the algae with inorganic nutrients and a haven from predation. Our laboratory is interested in answering fundamental questions about the biology and metabolism of dinoflagellates.In particular, we apply systems biology (metabolomics, transcriptomics, genomics), cell biology, and genetic approaches to understand coral-algal symbiosis and toxin biosynthesis in red tide dinoflagellates.  Aiptasia-Symbiodiniaceae is a model system to study coral-algal symbiosis. Shown here is a fluorescence image of the top view of a symbiotic Aiptasia.

Collateral Antibiotic Sensitivity  Antimicrobial resistance is a problem facing our medical system due, in part, to evolution of resistant bacteria. In CF antibiotic resistance is more common than in the general public due to the continual administration of antibiotics given prophylactically or in response to an exacerbation. It has long been recognized that bacteria can display cross-resistance (when a bacterium develops resistance to one antibiotic it simultaneously becomes resistant to another antibiotic, even without exposure to that second antibiotic). Recent studies have demonstrated collateral sensitivity. In response to antibiotic treatment a bacterium becomes resistant, and then, in response to treatment with a different antibiotic, eventually develops resistance to that second antibiotic. Collateral sensitivity (CS) is when a bacterium that developes resistance to a treatment antibiotic (abx #1) also becomes sensitive to a different (i.e. non-treatment antibiotic [abx #2]). In reciprocal CS, if that bacterium resistant to abx #1 is then evolved to become resistant to abx #2, it simultaneously loses resistance to abx #1. This little studied phenomenon suggests the possibility of addressing antibiotic resistance by cycling between the two antibiotics in a reciprocal CS pair. The challenge is to identify the antibiotic combinations that lead to collateral sensitivity as well as the mechanism underlying the phenomenon. Burkholderia multivorans, a member of the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), is a Gram negative bacillus that is a pathogen often found in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) . We are exploring collateral sensitivity and cross-resistance networks in B. multivorans and B. cenocepacia. Our goals are to 1) develop a collection of strains evolved to be resistant by serially exposing clinical isolates of Burkholderia to one of eight clinically-relevant antibiotics, 2) test resultant strains against the other seven drugs to determine collateral resistance and susceptibility patterns, 3) subject evolved strains to whole genome sequencing to identify candidate mutations and genes involved in cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity, and 4) introduce candidate mutations into wild type strains to confirm which mutations/genes are involved in CS. To date, goals 1, 2 and 3 have been accomplished to varying degrees (see DOI:10.1089/mdr.2019.0202 and DOI:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105994). Funding from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation was recently obtained in collaboration with Dr. Way Sung (UNC Charlotte, Bioinformatics & Genomics Dep\u2019t) to expand these studies to include additional antibiotics and Burkholderia species.  Change in Microbiota in CF Patients in Response to Antibiotic Treatment. In Cystic Fibrosis (CF), a mutation in the CFTR gene results in the production of thick, sticky mucus in the lungs that is difficult to remove. Bacteria that are normally not pathogenic in the lungs grow in this mucus and cause a chronic infection and inflammatory immune response. In CF patients, there are several bacteria that are resistant to most known antibiotics, making treatment difficult. Bacteria in CF patients are usually characterized in a clinic by cultivation techniques, but culturing only identifies a fraction of bacteria. New developments in sequencing technology are revolutionizing the study of complex microbial communities. The goals of this project are to: 1) identify indicator bacteria and viruses whose change in abundance or diversity presage onset of a pulmonary exacerbation or other changes in patient health, 2) identify bacteria and viruses that are involved in disease progression, and 3) determine how antibiotics affect the microbial population in the lung. These goals serve as the foundation for development of personalized courses of treatment to manage infections. The two main techniques used to monitor the microbiota are Illumina sequencing and qPCR. In experiments analyzing sputum samples from a CF patient via Illumina sequencing and qPCR, the data indicate that 1) bacteria diversity can be high in CF patients not having an active infection, 2) while the presence of most taxa present in the lung change over time, a few specific pathogens are present in all samples, 3) bacterial diversity and abundance correlates with antibiotic treatment, and 4) standard antibiotic treatment does not remove all bacteria from the lung (see DOI: 10.1128/JCM.02555-14.).NIH funding was received to expand this study to 15 adolescent CF patients.

We also study ligand binding to proteins using affinity capillary electrophoresis\u201d (ACE), which exploits the accompanying change in protein electrophoretic mobility. Combining charge ladders and ACE allows us to characterize overall conformational changes caused by ligand binding. And with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection, we can study the conformational behavior of fluorescently labeled proteins under simulated intracellular conditions\u2014especially in the presence of high concentrations of other macromolecules. We also have an active collaboration with a group in the Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics. We are using a variant of ACE called CEMSA\u201d (capillary electrophoretic mobility shift assay) to detect binding of transcription factors (TFs) to synthetic, fluorescently labeled DNA probes. We use this technique to experimentally validate predicted TF binding site sequences. After screening by CEMSA, we can identify affinity-purified TFs using mass spectrometry.

My friends sometimes jokingly refer to my research as \u2018blob\u2013ology\u2019. To the untrained eye, the results of modeling our data actually do look like \u2018blobs\u2019. If we have been attentive to the preparation of our samples as well as to the data collection/analysis process, however, what these models represent, are the low-resolution shape of a folded, functional protein.   High-resolution structures of the same protein in similar buffer conditions (such as that from the x-ray crystal structure shown on the right here)should fit well within our small-angle scattering based models. (As seen in the figure to the left). Why is shape important? A protein is a polymeric molecule, a long chain of individual units linked covalently together. In the case of a protein polymer, it is of a specific length and unit sequence. Every living system creates ~3000 different proteins, which function to do the chemical work required to sustain life. For proteins to function, those chains must fold up into a unique, often globular, form. It is the shape of a protein that dictates its function. Sometimes protein function is regulated(turned on or off) by other molecules through shape changes. The protein you see above is regulated by calcium ions, and its shape changes dramatically when calcium binds to it. We characterized this shape change by small-angle scattering and published our results in the Journal of Biological Chemistry 2007.  Our research will provide structural insights into the shape changes that are involved in activating or de-activating a protein. This regulatory process is referred to by biologists as \u2018signal transduction\u2019. There are a myriad of signal transduction mechanisms that work to keep living systems alive. Our scientific approach can provide a structural understanding of how a living system receives and responds to environmental information to elicit an appropriate response.

We pursue fundamental studies of molecular and nanoscale systems to understand directed and self-assembly processes. We aim to design new particles and materials with higher functionality and effectiveness. Our long-term interests are toward: novel mechanisms for mechanical transducers and sensors in NEMS, energy storage in supercapacitors, catalytic solar fuel production, water purification, and optical metamaterials.  We start by synthesizing novel coordination complexes that have useful and tunable spectral, electrochemical, and mechanical properties. We synthesize and purify single walled carbon nanotubes. We use various metal nanoparticles, quantum dots, and nanostructured carbons linked together by our coordination complexes to form higher order hybrid-nanomaterials. Some of these novel particles can be assembled into supraparticle assemblies with novel properties and function. Students in the Poler Research Group use many of the facilities and techniques in the Center for Optics and Optoelectronics, the Regional Analytical Chemistry Lab and the Department of Chemistry. Students are trained in clean room techniques (deposition, etching, growth, characterization). Students use various microscopy techniques including SEM, TEM, AFM, and STM. We use various spectroscopic methods such as: UV-Vis-NIR, Raman, IR, NMR, ESI-MS, circular dichroism, and fluoresce spectroscopy (steady state and time resolved). Materials and dispersions are also characterized by various thermal and mechanical methods including DMA, DSC, TGA, and isothermal titration calorimetry. Students use Static and Dynamic Particle sizing and zeta potential measurements on nanoparticle dispersions. We also support our experimental observations with computational modeling using the Materials Studio suite. We use high level DFT calculations on large cluster systems by running on multiple parallel processors maintained by the High Performance Computing center at UNC Charlotte.

The introduction of fluorine substituents in the arene pincers alters the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) in the binding cavity \u2013 in contrast to almost all known molecular tweezers the MEP is inverted \u2013 and thus induces a selectivity for electron-rich guests, e.g., electron-rich arenes or anions. The non-covalent p-p and anion-p interactions between the tweezers and guest units are of fundamental importance in supramolecular chemistry with potential applications in biology, chemistry and their interface. Novel fluorinated molecular tweezers will therefore significantly expand experimental data for molecular recognition that is based on the aforementioned supramolecular binding motifs. Ultimately we target sensing and sequestration of biologically important and environmentally hazardous species, respectively. b) Strained cage hydrocarbons have traditionally played an important role in (physical) organic chemistry and the group investigates neglected cage olefins. The study of their photochemistry toward more complex structures, the reactivity mode of the olefin units (1,2-; 1,4- vs. laticyclic addition) as well as the preparation of new organometallic complexes are central topics of our endeavors.

Dr. Quinlan is the Director of an Interdisciplinary Minor, Health/Medical Humanities and received the Bonnie E. Cone Early Career Professorship in Teaching (2015-2018). She explores how communication creates, resists and transforms knowledges about bodies. She critiques power structures in order to empower individuals who are marginalized inside and outside of healthcare systems. Additionally, her scholarly work explores the organizing of health care resources and work opportunities for people with lived differences. Dr. Quinlan authored approximately 40 journal articles, 17 book chapters and co-produced documentaries in a regional Emmy award-winning series (National Distribution with PBS and available on Amazon). Dr. Quinlan has published in Health Communication,Text & Performance Quarterly, Disability Studies Quarterly, Communication Education, Women & Language, Women\u2019s ReproductiveHealth, Qualitative Research in Medicine and Healthcare, International Journal of Health and Media Research, Sexuality & Culture, Journal of Research in Special Education Needs, and Journal of Holistic Nursing.

Johnson and Quinlan find surprising parallels between today\u2019s mothering experts and their Victorian counterparts, but they also explore how social media has placed unprecedented pressures on new mothers wrestling with familiar concerns and crises from pre-conception through early toddlerhood.

A. (1982) Saint Joseph\u2019s University Dr. Arrigo began his professional career as a community organizer for and social activist on behalf of: (1) the homeless and marginally housed; (2) users of (mental) health services; (3) adult and juvenile ex-offenders; (4) survivors of sexual assault; and (5) abusers of licit/illicit drugs. Professor Arrigo\u2019s work with these vulnerable and/or victimized constituencies culminated when he directed and implemented the social designing housing strategy for the city of Pittsburgh\u2019s largest single room occupancy (SRO) facility, Wood St. Commons. His civic engagement in this area also included developing and managing the facility\u2019s human welfare and social policy agenda. During his Directorship (1987-1990), this agenda addressed the unmet needs of under-served and non-served children, adults, and families. Professor Arrigo was awarded the Ph.D. from the Department of Sociology and Criminology at the Pennsylvania State University in the Administration of Justice where he specialized in the study of law, mental health, and policy. He has additional graduate training in Law (Temple University), as well as advanced degrees in Psychology (Duquesne University) and in Sociology (Duquesne University). He served as founding Director of the Institute of Psychology, Law, and Public Policy at the California School of Professional Psychology-Fresno (1996-2001), and as Chair of the Department of Criminal Justice at the University of North Carolina \u2013 Charlotte (2001-2004). Dr. Arrigo\u2019s research and scholarship is interdisciplinary in its scope, and it is pertinent to the advancement of human justice and social change across a wide range of public interest controversies. More specifically, he relies upon normative, doctrinal, and/or qualitative methods of inquiry to investigate enduring problems or emerging issues in: (1) law, health, and policy; (2) theory, culture, and society; and (3) disorder, crime, and punishment. His exploration of these problems and issues extends from the interpersonal to the global and from the transnational to the transpersonal, resulting in more than 200 peer-reviewed journal articles, law reviews, chapters in books, and academic essays. He is also the (co)author or (co)editor of more than 30 titles and volumes, published or in press. Recent books include Revolution in penology: Rethinking the society of captives (Rowman & Littlefield, 2009), and The ethics of total confinement: A critique of madness, citizenship, and social justice (Oxford University Press, 2011). Recent textbooks and/or reference works include Introduction to forensic psychology 3rd ed. (Elsevier, 2012), The Routledge handbook of international crime and justice studies (Routledge, 2014), and The encyclopedia of criminal justice ethics, vol., 1-2 (Sage, 2014).

Professor Arrigo was the founding Book Series Editor for Criminal Justice and Psychology (Carolina Academic Press) and for Critical Perspectives in Criminology (University of Illinois Press). He is also the General Editor for the 3-volume set, The encyclopedia of surveillance, security, and privacy (Sage, forthcoming). Professor Arrigo is the recipient of numerous professional awards and/or recognitions, and these honors are indicative of his prominence as a cross-disciplinary and multidisciplinary educator. Examples include: (1) elected Fellow, American Psychological Association (Div. 41, Law and Psychology) and elected Fellow, Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences; (2) Lifetime Achievement Award, Society for the Study of Social Problems (Div. on Crime and Juvenile Delinquency) and Lifetime Achievement Award, American Society of Criminology (Div. on Critical Criminology); and (3) the Joseph B.

Prior to joining the faculty at UNCCharlotte, Dr. Phillips served as an analyst and methodologist for the US Intelligence Community. His research interests span three broad areas. The first area of research concerns transnational organized crime, to include international drug trafficking, terrorism, and human trafficking. He has recently been investigating the intersection between drug trafficking and terrorist activity cross-nationally, and the phenomenon of narco-terrorism in Latin America and Southwest Asia. He has published case studies on the Islamic State and the Taliban, and was recently featured in the Washington Post. His transnational crime research is also heavily concerned with human trafficking, and has investigated the international prosecution of human trafficking, as well as the facilitation of commercial sex trafficking through the internet, social media, and the deep web. A second area of research is in the applications of big data\u201d and data analytic initiatives to the study of crime, particularly within the realm of national security. His emerging work in this area seeks to understand how data analytics can supplement the traditional mathematical and statistical techniques used in criminological research, and how these tools can be leveraged by governmental and law enforcement agencies. The final area of research involves the relationship between individual drug offending and delinquency, primarily violent offending. He has tested these relationships using data from the Rochester Youth Development Study, an on-going longitudinal panel study of youth at high risk for violence and delinquency. He has also used data from this project to study criminological research methods, statistics, and quantitative analytic techniques.

He has published several articles related to understanding the nature and extent of sexual victimization as it occurs on college campuses. More recently, he has been awarded a grant from the U.S. Department of Education to implement and evaluate an educational intervention to reduce the rate of binge drinking on college campuses. Finally, a third area of research involves understanding resiliency and desistance from delinquency and crime.

His research centers on examining theories of criminal behavior and on program evaluation. In his research on criminological theory Dr. Exum generally incorporates concepts based in psychology including emotion, psychopharmacology, and personality. For example, he has published articles examining the effects of alcohol and anger on violent decision-making within a rational choice perspective. He has also examined how personality traits influence decisions to engage in such crimes as corporate offending and sexual assault. His current research involves using a rational choice perspective to examine the effects of group dynamics on cheating among college students. Dr. Exum\u2019s evaluation research includes an assessment of Baltimore City\u2019s drug court program. He has also evaluated the impact of the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department\u2019s Domestic Violence Unit on reducing repeat offending and repeat victimization, a project funded by the National Institute of Justice.

He is the author of Resisting Dialogue: Modern Fiction and the Future of Dissent (University of Minnesota Press, 2019) and has published or forthcoming articles and book chapters on a variety of themes and topics (see below). He is currently at work on two book projects. The first is tentatively titled Denizens! On Foreigners, Invaders, and Other Outsiders. This book takes a wide-ranging view and considers\u2014against the grain of the idea of citizenship\u2014how issues such as colonization, migration, the environment, labor, and the future of the human shed light onto an alternative way of being in the world. The other book project is a collection of key terms in the style of Raymond Williams\u2019s landmark Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society. Tentatively titled Z to A: A Vocabulary for the Post-Political Era, it provides a full, critical picture of the most important social, cultural, and historical issues that define the current post-political moment through entries such as F for Focus,\u201d J for Job,\u201d I for Investor,\u201d and P for Pandemic.\u201d  Book  Juan Meneses, Resisting Dialogue: Modern Fiction and the Future of Dissent. University of Minnesota Press, 2019.  Resisting Dialogue: Modern Fiction and the Future of Dissent reassesses our assumptions about dialogue and, in so doing, about what a politically healthy society should look like. The book argues that, far from an unalloyed good, dialogue often serves as a subtle tool of domination, perpetuating the underlying inequalities it is intended to address. With an investigation at its center of illusory dialogue\u201d (a particular dialogic encounter designed to secure consensus and eliminate dissent), the book offers a series of close readings of novels from the English-speaking world written in the past hundred years to show ways of restoring the radical potential of dialogue. Expanding the boundaries of post-political theory, Resisting Dialogue reveals how these works offer ways to practice disagreement against this regulatory use of dialogue and expose the pitfalls of certain other dialogic interventions in relation to some of the most prominent questions of modern history: cosmopolitanism at the end of empire, the dangers of rewriting the historical record, the affective dimension of neoliberalism, the racial and nationalist underpinnings of the war on terror,\u201d and the visibility of environmental violence in the Anthropocene.

I published a scholarly monograph on the poetry of Rita Dove with University of Illinois Press (2003) and a book of substantial interviews with eight post-black arts movement poets with University of Georgia Press (2010). My most recent work, published in 2019 and 2020, on the poetry of Thylias Moss, Brenda Marie Osbey and Natasha Trethewey, is complemented by an ongoing interest in highlighting the poetic achievements of Wanda Coleman. I regularly present my scholarship on contemporary Black poetry as a panelist and keynote speaker at international conferences, most recently in Bergen, Shanghai, Warsaw, and Graz. Currently, I am working on a book project focused on Black ekphrastic poetry and serve as the elected chair of the advisory board for the Furious Flower Poetry Center at James Madison University, the nation\u2019s first academic center for Black poetry. In the honors world, I am co-authoring a chapter for a National Collegiate Honors Council monograph on honors colleges; our chapter interrogates the prevalence of white male honors college deans, and what to do about it.

The question \u2018What is a child?\u2019 feeds invariably into the next question: \u2018What language does a child need?\u2019 Those two questions have generated substantially different kinds of children\u2019s literature. I am looking specifically at the Bureau of Educational Experiments (BEE, founded 1916 in NYC). It answered the first question with: \u2018Children have innate skills: a poetic sensibility for language, whole-body sensorimotor learning, and exceptional observational acuity. If those skills are preserved rather than suppressed (read: in traditional school settings), those children will grow up to be future writers, artists, and scientists.\u2019 That answer generated a very interesting response to the second question: \u2018Children need language specifically designed for their skill levels at successive maturational periods (infancy through 7 years).\u2019 Interdisciplinary scientific testing and experimenting with stories and manuscripts led, over the following 30 years, to the development of age-appropriate children\u2019s literature, with a trajectory of best-selling authors leading from Lucy Sprague Mitchell to Margaret Wise Brown and Dorothy Meserve Kunhardt. Authors like Gertrude Stein and Theodor Seuss Geisel\u2013whether they acknowledged it or not\u2013also profited from the paths broken at BEE, as can be established from the novel linguistic profiles of their children\u2019s books.

(1977) Geological Sciences, Virginia Tech B.S. (1974) Geology, Birmingham-Southern College  Profile My long-term research interests include the tectonics and regional geology of the Southern Appalachian Mountains, particularly within the eastern crystalline core of the chain. Numerous embedded orogen-parallel ductile shear zones in this area contain kinematic indicators for strike- or oblique-slip during mid- to late-Paleozoic deformation that is more characteristically compressional in the western part of the mountain belt. In addition to the Paleozoic kinematic significance of these structures, many shear zones also were reactivated to nucleate Mesozoic rift basins. I have continued to evaluate all of these relationships in field sites throughout North Carolina and Virginia. Part of my research in continuous deformation is theoretical. It is clear in many ductile shear zones that deformation cannot be exclusively pure shear or simple shear. This recognition leads to the need to establish models for shear that incorporate vorticity components of pure and simple shearing. The result of this analysis is the kinematic vorticity number, a measure of the balance between shearing components that has been found to be verifiable with field studies. This line of research is intermittent, but continues to be of interest. I also am involved in studies of neo-tectonics. In the Appalachians, neo-tectonics\u201d often refers to the identification of structures that could be related to Tertiary and/or Quaternary activity. I have previously studied potential neo-tectonic areas along the Fall Line in eastern Virginia. Presently, I am planning an investigation of possible Quaternary faulting in the western Virginia Piedmont in the Mountain Run fault zone, which lies at the physiographic boundary between the Blue Ridge and Piedmont provinces. Recently I have been working with Missy Eppes and John Diemer to investigate an area of active deformation along the northern piedmont of the San Bernardino Mountains in California. There we have used ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to delineate sub-surface structures in an active faulted anticline. This work continues with additional near-surface geophysics and structural mapping to provide a model for the fault-fold relationship there. I teach applied geophysics and also use some of these tools in field research. In addition to the GPR work in California, with John Diemer and Missy Eppes and a class of graduate students we have done GPR profiles of pond sediment and colluvial debris in the western Piedmont of North Carolina. Also, with Craig Allan and John Diemer we have compiled a grid of GPR profiles in Ontario, Canada to assist in the study of the sub-surface component of a watershed study. I am currently involved in an on-going research project with John Diemer and Missy Eppes to study the source and distribution of home radon in the eastern Inner Piedmont of North Carolina. This project area, which is funded by the NC Radiation Protection Office, is located where radon concentrations are known to be above background values for the region. I maintain a program of outreach and innovation in geoscience education. For several years, I have taught an intense, hands-on summer institute for in-service K-12 schoolteachers. This field- and lab-based course is oriented on content and experience. I also am actively involved in developing online physical geology courses for non-science majors or teachers through UNC Charlotte and through the UNC general administration.

I grew up near Chicago, andhave been a weather weenie for as long as I can remember. I am particularly passionate about severe weather, whichmotivates my primary research interest in the dynamics of severe storms. I participated in VORTEX2, a large multi-agency field project that set out to learn more about how tornadoes and tornadic thunderstorms work. The project also inspired my current research trajectory focusing on the impact of heterogeneous environments on storm evolution. I am also interested in better understanding how changes to environments influence internal processes and storm behavior, using both observations and idealized modeling. My proximity to the Appalachian Mountains further inspires me to investigate the interaction of thunderstorms and complex terrain.

While I am interested in both patterns of regional development and the processes that produce them, my approach to teaching and research emphasizes empiricism and policy relevance. To that end, my research has focused on interregional patterns of spatial income distribution; the impact of urban form on segregation, spatial mismatch, business location, and metropolitan growth; the relationship of unearned\u201d income (transfer payments, interest, dividends, rent) to local employment; the impact of professional sports teams and facilities on metro areas; and industry clusters in regions undergoing rapid structural change. I also conduct economic impact assessments and program evaluations. Many of these research activities also find their way into my classroom. I am a firm believer that students at all levels are best served when they can apply theory and concepts to real issues of development, planning and policy. Over the years, my students have conducted cost-benefit analyses of industry incentives; estimated the attendance impact of new sports facilities; and devised economic development strategies for local governments.

(2002) Earth & Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico B.S. (1997) Earth & Planetary Sciences, University of New Mexico  Profile  I have an intense interest in finding new and creative ways to reach students in large lecture classrooms. The format of traditional introductory geology and earth science courses is often ineffective in conveying fundamental scientific ideas to a general audience. The use of new technology and unique lecture styles to engage students is an area of active and continuous research for me. When I am not focused on the classroom, I am in interested in the geomorphology of alpine landscapes and the paleolclimatic proxy information they may contain. The last 20,000 years has been a time of significant climatic change, including the end of the last ice age and recent global warming. Understanding the timing of past climatic changes and deciphering their primary forcing mechanisms is of particular interest. Climatically sensitive alpine environments in and around the Colorado Plateau in the southwestern U.S. have provided an excellent venue for obtaining high-resolution evidence of these paleoclimatic changes. This data is largely recovered from low energy, depositional glacial features like cirques, kettle bogs, and kettle lakes. Obtaining these continuous, high-resolution sedimentary records is often a challenging and grueling logistical task and one that I relish! It is becoming more evident every day that our water resources are becoming increasingly stressed. The supply of sufficient and healthy drinking water is becoming increasingly challenging for a growing populace. Understanding the interaction of ground water, surface water, and contaminants is another area of personal interest. Across the midlatitude regions of the world, over reliance on ground water and the pollution of surface water is coming to a head. I am interest in increasing out understanding of how these reservoirs are connected in various geologic settings and using that information to initiate new and innovative ways to obtain, conserve, and protect these resources.

Geography, University of Georgia M.A. (1993) Geography, University of North Carolina at Charlotte B.S. (1990) Earth Sciences, University of North Carolina at Charlotte  Profile Greetings! My interests within geography reflect to varying degrees my research and teaching pathways. I currently teach courses ranging from the general education LBST 2301 (Critical Thinking and Communication) to applied spatial demography (GEOG 4255/52255). Topically, I teach courses in the regional geographies of the US and Canada and of the South ( GEOG 2155 and GEOG 2160), global food issues (GEOG 3250) and human-environment interactions (ESCI 2101 Environmental Dilemma). My interest in teaching extends to the richly rewarding world\u201d of geographic education. I enjoy working with pre-service and in-service teachers to expand our collective knowledge of geography in K-12 curricula. I am an active member of the National Council for Geographic Education (NCGE) which provides an essential connection to improving pedagogy and disseminating research findings. Further, I have an emerging interest in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) at the pre-collegiate and collegiate levels. In addition to these areas of study, I examine aspects of demographic aging, migration processes among working age and elderly populations, and housing vulnerability among the elderly. My future research agenda will continue to include this interest in the spatial implications of aging populations. This is an increasingly important public policy issue as the large and influential baby boom\u201d cohort reaches the later phases of the life course. Regionally, I have a long-standing interest in the historical and contemporary geographies of Appalachia as well as the spatio-temporal dynamics of cultural landscape formation in the South. Within the Department, I serve as the Undergraduate Coordinator for Geography. In this role, I am happy to meet with students (prospective, current or graduated majors) to discuss any aspect of Geography. I am the co-advisor for two student clubs in Geography: the Zeta Omega chapter of Gamma Theta Upsilon (international geography honor society) and the Charlotte Geography Club.

That research has resulted in numerous publications including two well-received books prepared in collaboration with Michael Collie. Our second book was published by the British Geological Survey in 2004 and is entitled Murchison\u2019s Wanderings in Russia. It is an annotated edition of Murchison\u2019s autobiographical journal where he describes his experiences during two field seasons in Russia, 1840 and 1841. During those field campaigns, Murchison, together with his colleagues Edouard de Verneuil and Alexander von Keyserling, mapped all of Russia in Europe including the Ural Mountains.

I grew up in central Indiana and became fascinated with the weather at anyoung age. My early motivation in meteorology was to study the Antarctic ozone hole, but a series of circumstances and opportunities during my pursuit of an undergraduate degree at Purdue University pulled me toward hurricanes and severe weather. Since then, I have never looked back. During graduate school at Colorado State University, I had the opportunity to visit the NOAA Hurricane Research Division on an annual basis and to participate in their field program, during which they fly through tropical cyclones \u2014 an incredible experience! Since completing my graduate studies, livingin Florida, Iowa, and North Carolina has diversified my scientific interests into the societal impacts of weather and urban meteorology. As a scientist, I\u2019m interested in the physical processes that influence the formation and evolution of atmospheric systems. To this end, my general research interests encompass all aspects of tropical cyclones, organized mesoscale weather systems, and the influence of weather/climate on society and ecosystems. My specific research has focused on (1) understanding how elevated terrain can influence the structure and intensity of severe storms; (2) forecasting thunderstorm-induced power outages; (3) impacts of urban meteorology and the urban heat island on urban energy use and urban ecosystems; (4) relationships between the mosquito-transmitted dengue fever virus and weather variability across tropical regions; (5) understanding the ingredients favorable for supercell and tornado formation within a landfalling tropical cyclone circulation; (6) evaluating the use of micropalentological proxies to reconstruct the paleotempestology of hurricane landfalls; and (7) understanding the structure and evolution of tropical cyclones including eyewall convection and miniature supercells in outer rainbands. My teaching interests includethe areas of tropical, mesoscale, radar, urban, and synopticmeteorology, as well asatmospheric thermodynamics and instrumentation. I also teach a professional development seminar for seniors.

Growing up in PA, the obvious choice of college for me was Penn State and their great meteorology program. I graduated with a BS (2002) and an MS (2004) degree in meteorology and amassed quite a bit of teaching experience as both a lab instructor and general education instructor. My graduate work focused on atmospheric oxidation in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) and how to improve air quality in large metro centers. After graduation, I taught for one year at Bloomsburg University in north-eastern PA in their geography department, teaching both meteorology and physical geography courses. In the summer of 2006, I moved to Charlotte, NC and began my career at UNC Charlotte as a Meteorologist/Senior Lecturer in the Department of Geography and Earth Sciences and became part of a great team of atmospheric scientists in a program that we\u2019ve worked so hard to build and expand!

She earned her PhD in 2015 from the Interdisciplinary Program of Language, Literacy, and Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), where she also taught for the Gender and Women\u2019s Studies Department courses on introduction to women\u2019s studies, feminist methodologies, critical masculinities, and gender and globalization. Dr. Ergun\u2019s area of expertise is at the junction of transnational feminisms, cultural globalization, and feminist translation studies. More specifically, her research focuses on the role of translation in connecting feminist activists, discourses, and movements across geopolitical borders, particularly between the US and Turkey. Before coming to UNC Charlotte, Dr. Ergun worked as a contract lecturer at the Women\u2019s and Gender Studies Department at Keene State College in New Hampshire, where she taught courses on women of color feminisms, feminist activisms, and the politics of sex and virginity. Dr. Ergun is currently co-editing with Dr. Olga Castro of Aston University, a collection of essays called Feminist Translation Studies: Transnational and Local Perspectives. The volume aims to reconfigure feminist translation as a substantial force and form of political activism locally and transnationally. That is, the volume seeks to expand our understanding of feminist action not only to include feminist translation as feminist activism against multiple forms of domination, but also to rethink feminist translation through feminist theories and practices developed in different geohistorical and disciplinary contexts. By so doing, the collection seeks to expand the geopolitical and historical scope of the field of feminist translation studies from different disciplinary perspectives so that it becomes more transnational, interdisciplinary, and overtly political. Feminist Translation Studies is to be published by Routledge in March 2017. Dr. Ergun is also working on her first manuscript drawing on her doctoral dissertation. In this work, Dr. Ergun explores the ways in which the debiologizing virginity theories and knowledges of Hanne Blank\u2019s Virgin: The Untouched History (2007), an American book on the history of western virginities, traveled from the U.S. to Turkey through her politically engaged translation (2008). Conceiving feminist translation as subjective, local, and transnational activism, Dr. Ergun\u2019s research examines two key aspects of cross-border traveling of feminist virginity discourses: 1) the creative processes of feminist translation and the performative role of the translator\u2019s agency in these processes, 2) the receptions of the translated text in Turkey by feminist readers and the implications of their reading practices for local and transnational feminist politics. Comparing the U.S. and Turkey, two unevenly positioned cultures with different configurations of virginity and different legacies of feminist politics, the manuscript illustrates how a western book on women\u2019s sexuality was crossculturally mobilized to unsettle Turkey\u2019s virginity codes and what kinds of transgressive effects it generated within Turkey\u2019s feminist communities and the political lessons this textual travel process revealed for building transnational feminist solidarities. Dr. Ergun received the 2013 National Women Studies Association\u2019s (NWSA) Graduate Student Award for this research, given to works that contribute to feminist scholarship that is comparative, global, intersectional and interdisciplinary.\u201d The dissertation was also selected as a finalist for the 2015 NWSA and the University of Illinois\u2019 First Book Prize.

Her work interrogates some of the social and political categories through which everyday life is navigated. It focuses on questions of identity and conflict, religion and the secular, nationalism, citizenship, sovereignty, and colonialism. Looking at the work of historical representations in contemporary conflict, she reconceptualizes such conflicts by considering the ways historical events are variously imagined, and how alternatives to history\u201d itself might act as a framework for understanding conflict. The space of Israel/Palestine has served as herprimary empirical case, and critical and postcolonial theory the primary conceptual framework for thinking through these issues. Israel/Palestine is particularly useful in challenging and renovating particular aspects ofcritical theory. Dalsheim\u2019s work aims at seeing things otherwise by making unexpected comparisons and contrasts\u2014the hallmark of anthropological analysis. Much anthropology has been concerned with giving voice to the subaltern, minorities, and oppressed peoples. Dalsheim expands on these comparative projects by taking on what Laura Nader called the challenge of studying up.\u201d Her work looks athegemonic groups, exploring the analytical usefulness of ideas such as hegemonic and subaltern. These issues are explored in numerous journal articles, book chapters, and in Dalsheim\u2019s first three books: Unsettling Gaza: Secular Liberalism, Radical Religion, and the Israeli Settlement Project (Oxford 2011), andProducing Spoilers: Peacemaking and Production of Enmity in a Secular Age (Oxford 2014), and Israel Has a Jewish Problem: Self-Determination as Self-Elimination (Oxford 2019). Dalsheim came to UNC-Charlotte following aRockefeller Fellowship at the Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame, anda Lady Davis Fellowship at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. She previously taught atThe Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, and Wake Forest University.At UNC-Charlotte, Dalsheim teaches foundational courses in the concentration in Peace, Conflict, and Identity in the Department of Global Studies. Her courses are also cross-listed with Anthropology. She regularly offers courses on Cultures and Conflicts, Israel/Palestine and the role of Narratives in Conflict. She also works to de-colonize the curriculum through a project called Reading is Research.

He previously served as national historian for the US Forest Service in Washington, DC, where he was involved with a wide variety of public history projects including historical films, websites, oral histories, interpretive planning, exhibit development, historic preservation, and heritage tourism initiatives. In addition, Shapiro worked on collections management and federal records issues and regularly provided historical policy papers for staff. As agency historian, he developed relationships with interagency and non-profit partners to further the goals of the agency history program. Before joining the Forest Service, Shapiro was Assistant Director of the Scholl Center for Family and Community History at Chicago \u2018s Newberry Library. At the Newberry he served as academic director for two Department of Education Teaching American History grants, working cooperatively with the Chicago Public Schools and Chicago-area cultural and non-profit institutions. Shapiro received his MA and PhD in History from the University of Chicago and a BA in History from the University of Pennsylvania. He is particularly interested in questions regarding the intersection of people and place, changing perspectives of the cultural and natural landscape, and connections between memory, heritage, and public historical interpretation. His research explores questions about the history of land use and environmental change, modern environmental politics, the relationship between work and leisure, and broader cultural transformations in twentieth century urban and rural America.

Current Projects (1) Dissenting Daughters: Reformed Women in the Dutch Republic, 1572-1725highlights women\u2019s contributions to the spread of the Reformed faith by examining the lives and written works of six women, Cornelia Teellinck (1553-1576), Susanna Teellinck (1551-1625), Anna Maria van Schurman (1607-1678), Sara Nevius (1632-1706), Cornelia Leydekker (1654-1725), and Henrica van Hoolwerff (1658-1704). These women drew upon the authority accorded to them as domestic religious instructors, as well as their family networks and ministerial connections, to teach others and to publish original works to amplify the influence of the nascent Dutch Reformed Church that excluded them from official roles. (2) I am also working on a book-length project that traces the international spread of domestic advice books in response to religious persecution, trade, and voluntary travel. It compares the content of advice to parents printed in German, Dutch, English, and French and identifies women active within these networks of religious exchange to highlight instances in which ministers provided women with the tools to write and publish devotional texts by insisting that women engage in domestic religious practices including reading and writing devotional texts, offering religious instruction, and even leading home worship services.

Her book traces the origins of what some white Argentines mischaracterize as a black disappearance\u201d by delving into the intimate lives of black women and explaining how they contributed to the making of a white\u201d Argentina. Erika Denise Edwards has produced the first comprehensive study in English of the history of African descendants outside of Buenos Aires in the late colonial and early republican periods, with a focus on how these women sought whiteness to better their lives and those of their children. Edwards argues that attempts by black women to escape the stigma of blackness by recategorizing themselves and their descendants as white began as early as the late eighteenth century, challenging scholars who assert that the black population drastically declined at the end of the nineteenth century because of the whitening or modernization process. She further contends that in C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina, women of African descent (such as wives, mothers, daughters, and concubines) were instrumental in shaping their own racial reclassifications and destinies.

Current Projects I am currently working on a book-length project that examines how biomedicine and doctors both empowered and disrupted the system of South African indenture (1860-1911). Biomedicine was used and imagined as a tool of empire and industry, and also subject to the competing visions and responsibilities of various colonial forces, doctors, and the emergent field of public health. I am particularly interested in the international dimensions of this phenomenon, from negotiations between various colonial powers\u2014Britain, India, and Natal\u2014to evolving biomedical understandings of diseases like hookworm within tropical medicine. In particular, I seek to determine the conditions, such as the rise of a public health administration, that emboldened whistle-blowers who nudged reform in a system overwhelmingly stacked in the favor of the rich and powerful.

By looking at a small domain with a scattered territory, I hope to find new answers to the question of what constituted a domain in Bakumatsu-era Japan, considering factors such as commerce, knowledge production and Western Learning, as well as occupational and local identity. This time, I am following reform initiatives that connected \u014cno to such places as Osaka, Edo, Tsuruga, Hakodate, and Karafuto (Sakhalin). I am currently examining how the domain, in the course of these reforms, relied on social groups that formed networks across domain borders: wholesalers, shipping agents, sailors, lacquer harvesters and -dealers, miners, non-Japanese people on Karafuto, and others.

Lansen is Teaching Professor and Director of Undergraduate Studies of the Department of History at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. As such, he oversees the departmental undergraduate program of nearly 400 majors and 100 minors. In addition, Oscar directs the Department\u2019s first-year program; and co-coordinates the six semi-annual University graduation ceremonies. He is a member of the Honors Faculty (and former Chair of the Honors Council), the Academic Integrity Board; and the Faculty Council. Oscar holds an affiliate appointment with the University\u2019s Center for Holocaust, Genocide, and Human Rights Studies.  Scholarship Oscar\u2019s scholarly interests lay in Dutch Holocaust History and in the pedagogy of history and teaching. As a scholar of the Holocaust, Oscar researches the plight of Jewish refugees to Latin America; in particularly Dutch-Jewish relations in the Netherlands and its overseas territories in the West. He has published on various aspects of the Holocaust in Dutch, English, and Spanish language journals; and participated in continuing scholarly exchanges \u2013 including appearances as Dutch national radio and most recently at Yad Vashem\u2019s School for International Holocaust Studies in Jerusalem. Oscar recently completed a Holocaust Education Foundation Grant to make Shoah education more widely available to college students. This coming year, he will serve as a staff historian on a Second Generation Holocaust Survivor testimonial project to preserve the familial eyewitness narrative. As pedagogue, Oscar\u2019s interests lay in teaching the unmasterable past; and in active learning didactics. Oscar has participated as part of the Eurclio study group reviewing and assisting the national curriculae in Latvia and Malta. Most recently he completed a study on immigration, education and vision of nationhood in the United States. Beside developing experiential source/experience-driven curricula on national and local levels, Oscar has developed visual-spatial analysis strategies for large lecture classroom settings and integrated freshmen/discipline-specific skill development techniques to transition, retain, and academically accelerate potentially vulnerable student populations. At UNC Charlotte, Oscar pioneered the freshmen-only experiential learning curriculae for small and large classroom settings for general and for honors students. Currently, history freshmen co-teach his seminar on the Holocaust. Oscar is a founding member of the Charlotte Teacher Institute, is editorial advisor to the didactical Journal Teaching History; and has given workshops and consulted on curriculae in the United States, Europe, and Asia. In addition, he serves in several leadership roles for the Advanced Placement European History exam development and reading. Oscar\u2019s research in history and pedagogy has been supported in part by internal and external grants and fellowships.  Teaching As a teacher, Oscar focuses on the impact of war and conflict on society; offering experiential topics, methods, and honors courses in seminar and large-lecture format on Children in War and Conflict; When Nations go to War; War and Peace in Modern Times; World War II; The Holocaust; Nazi Germany; Propaganda; and Teaching History. He is the co-recipient of several National Endowment of the Humanities Teaching Fellowships on minority perspectives in history, the experience of soldiers and civilians in war, and America in a global perspective. Oscar has received local and national awards for his teaching and service to education.  Community Besides the university classroom and peer training, Oscar frequently guest-lectures in middle and high schools; as well as offers a range of community lectures. The latter have included topics like The Vietnam-American War; How to Stop a Terrorist; The Churches and the Holocaust; The Jews of Curacao; The Mind of Adolf Hitler; and When Children go to War. He assisted in creating community-university partnerships to connect Liberal Arts with the business community and provide study-abroad grants for need-based undergraduates.

Instead of structuring state\u2013press relations through the dichotomies of power versus freedom and/or surveillance versus sedition, it imagines it as one in which newspapers served simultaneously as imprimaturs, mediators, and adversaries in relation to the state. Coercive the colonial state undoubtedly was; however, precisely because of its unrepresentative, top-heavy and remote nature, it also relied extensively \u2013 if not exclusively \u2013 on newspapers for some of its most urgent public needs: whether of representing itself as a legitimate sovereign power in India, of securing favourable reception for its endless stream of interventions, or of accessing enough local information to determine what administrative imperatives would drive its policy decisions. Attuned to such vulnerabilities and needs, journalists patently recognized their necessity to a colonial apparatus and the negotiating power that it engendered; however, they remained cognizant of the wide range of executive powers that the state still held over them. It was in this nebulous, uneven, and rapidly shifting landscape that the practical, everyday, relationship between state and press was negotiated, through a series of transactions that recognized the institutional power and constraints of both. As this book explores, many of the structures of modern governmentality and of its relationship with the modern press in India were produced within this thrust and parry, in which power could be monopolized by neither side, and in which the very mechanisms of regulation, control, and surveillance available to the state were deployed by journalists to recalibrate the relationship, whether in terms of the minutiae of their profession \u2013 from postage to subsidies \u2013 or in terms of their ideological claims to public authority.

He became an Assistant Professor in 2017, and he was promoted to Associate Professor in 2021. His book, Mestizo Modernity: Race, Technology, and the Body in Postrevolutionary Mexico(University of Florida Press, 2018) discusses the role of science and technology in racial construction in postrevolutionary Mexico. He is currently finishing a second book with a tentative title of Cyborgs and Ne[cr]oliberalism: Robo-Sacer Resistance in Mexican and Chicano/a/x Fantastic and Science Fiction, 1992-2018. This book interrogates the markets of death that appear in neoliberal-era literature and film from both Mexican and Chicano/a/x cultural producers. Technology emerges as a tool of domination that oppressed people can subvert in an attempt to demand equal rights. Dr. Dalton has taught numerous classes at the graduate and undergraduate levels. He has mentored several MA and Honors theses on the following topics: cultural memory in Latin American cinema; healthcare systems in Latin America; race and ethnicity in postrevolutionary Mexican cinema; religion and identity in Latin America.

It combines a strong theory with numerical results, which are based on this theory. In particular, I have many publications which describe the work of our numerical methods on experimental data. MAIN MATHEMATICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:  In a breakthrough work of 1981 has introduced, for the first time,the powerful tool of Carleman estimates in the field of Multidimensional Coefficient Inverse Problems (MCIPs). Publication:A.L. Buhgeim and M.V. Klibanov, Global uniqueness of a class of multidimensional inverse problems, Soviet Mathematics Doklady, 24, 244-247, 1981.This tool has allowed, for the first time, to prove global uniqueness theorems for broad classes of MCIPs with the non over-determined data. Contrary to this, only local uniqueness theorems were proven for such MCIPs prior to that. This idea is called nowadays The Bukhgeim-Klibanov method\u201d. This method has generated many publications of many authors. Currently, this remains the single method, enabling one to prove global uniqueness and stability theorems for MCIPs with non over-determined data. In addition, this idea has generated effective numerical methods, which I have developed later with some of coauthors. Item 3 is an example of those methods. Recent survey on this method: M.V. Klibanov,Carleman estimates for global uniqueness, stability and numerical methods for coefficient inverse problems, J. Inverse and Ill-Posed Problems, 21, 477-560, 2013. In 1997 has started, for the first time, the development of globally convergent numerical methods (GCM) for coefficient inverse problems (CIPs). This research addresses the following crucial question: How to rigorously obtain at least one point in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the exact solution without any advanced knowledge of this neighborhood? Two GCMs have been developed: (1) The so-called tail functions method and (2) The convexification method. Both are currently verified on experimental data. Both work with non-redundant data. All other numerical methods for coefficient inverse problems which work with non redundant data, converge onlylocally. The convergence of a locally convergent method to the exact solution is rigorously guaranteed only if the starting point of iterations is located in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the exact solution. This means that locally convergent numerical methods are inherently unstable, since solutions they deliver critically depend on the starting points for iterations. My current interest is in the convexification. The convexification constructs a weighted Tikhonov-like functional for a CIP. The weight is the Carleman Weight Function. This is the function which is involved in the Carleman estimate for the underlying Partial Differential Operator. Given a ball B(R) of an arbitrary radius R>0 in an appropriate Hilbert space, one can choose the parameter of the CWF in such a way that the above functional becomes strictly convex on B(R). The strict convexity, in turn, implies convergence to the exact solution of the gradient projection method. It is CRUCIAL that the starting point of this method is an arbitrary point of B(R). Since, in turn R>0 is an arbitrary number, then this is the GLOBAL convergence. In 2014 has proved, for the first time,uniqueness theorems for 3-d Inverse Scattering Problems without the phase information. Applications are in imaging of nanostructures and living biological cells. The first publication:M.V. Klibanov, Phaseless inverse scattering problems in three dimensions, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 74, 392-410, 2014. In 2015 has developed (jointly with V.G. Romanov), for the first time, reconstruction methods for3-d Inverse Scattering Problems without the phase information. One of those methods was computationally implemented. The first publication:M.V. Klibanov and V.G. Romanov, Reconstruction procedures for two inverse scattering problems without the phase information, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 76, 178-196, 2016. In particular, items 4 and 5 have solved a long standing problem posed by K. Chadan and P.C. Sabatier in in their bookInverse Problems in Quantum Scattering Theory, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1977. In 2016 has proposed the first rigorous numerical method for solving ill-posed Cauchy problems for quasilinear PDEs. The method is an an adaptation of the convexification. Previously ill-posed Cauchy problems were solved only for linear PDEs. Publication:M.V. Klibanov, Carleman weight functions for solving ill-posed Cauchy problems for quasilinear PDEs, Inverse Problems, 31, 125007, 2015. In 2016 has proposed a new mathematical model for the Black-Scholes equation. It was shown on real market data for 368 randomly chosen stock options that this model indeed helps to be quite profitable. Publication: M.V. Klibanov, A.V. Kuzhuget and K.V. Golubnichiy,An ill-posed problem for the Black\u2013Scholes equation for a profitable forecast of prices of stock options on real market data, Inverse Problems, 32, 015010, 2016. In 1991 has introduced, for the first time, the powerful tool of Carleman estimates in the Control Theory via proving the Lipschitz stability property for hyperbolic equations with the Cauchy data at the lateral side of the time cylinder and the book (initial conditions at t=0 are absent in this case). This idea became a common place since then in the Control Theory. Publication:M. V. Klibanov and J. Malinsky, Newton-Kantorovich method for 3-dimensional potential inverse scattering problem and stability for the hyperbolic Cauchy problem with time dependent data, Inverse Problems 7, 577\u2013596, 1991.

My first book \u2014 Universal Emancipation: Race beyond Badiou \u2014 was published with the University of Minnesota Press in October 2020. Currently, I am working on two book projects. The first book is an edited collection with a number of exceptional Badiou scholars, which centers around theories of sexuality in, through, and against Alain Badiou\u2019s conception of indifference to difference\u201d and what Louise Burchill calls Badiou\u2019s turn\u201d in a 2011 paper titled FiguresofFemininity in the Contemporary World.\u201d The second book is a single author manuscript on the writings of Sylvia Wynter.

The result is an engaging tumble through physics, physiology, photography, and robotics to uncover, through scientific debate, the secret of the acrobatic performance known as cat-turning, the cat flip, and the cat twist.

We are trying to understand the molecular logic underlying biological function. By nature, the research is highly interdisciplinary. Students will learn spectroscopic techniques (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence), molecular modeling, and gain basic biochemistry skills. Projects Structure-function-dynamics of proteins DNA transposition is the mechanism that can be used to deliver genetic information to mammalian genome. It has been employed for gene therapy and for functional genomics studies. The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system is the most frequently used DNA transposon in functional genomics, and is the first and only DNA transposon that has been adapted for human gene therapy. The SB system consists of the transposase enzyme and of the transposon DNA. From the biophysics point of view, the SB transposition is the sequence of steps during which the transposase interacts with the transposon DNA. Accordingly, we study these steps to create a dynamic picture with atomic-level resolution of how molecular components of the SB transposon system work together. Protein-protein interactions Chemokines form a large family of proteins that guide the migration of leukocytes in our body. We need chemokines to fight the infection, but they can also play a negative role by promoting autoimmune and allergic inflammatory reactions, cancer, atherosclerosis, or other inflammatory disorders. Chemokines act individually or interact to form heterooligomers. These interactions alter the biological activity of individual chemokines. We are looking at different chemokines to describe their interactions at atomic level in order to design molecule that will block (or enhance) the interactions, because we believe that it may lead to the development of more targeted, anti-inflammatory pharmacological agents with minimal side effects. Translational diffusion of proteins Biological processes depend on diffusive transport of molecules within cell and tissue. The first step of a biochemical reaction is the translational diffusion of at least one species to recognize another species involved in the reaction. To date, the translational diffusion of biopolymers, primarily globular proteins, has been studied in dilute solutions \u2013 idealized conditions required in most biophysical studies. We aim to understand the diffusion of biopolymers in solution in a wide range of concentrations when crowding is created by like or dislike molecules. Plant defensins Plant defensins form a family of proteins with a broad spectrum of protective activities against fungi, bacteria, and insects. Furthermore, some plant defensins have revealed anticancer activity. In general, plant defensins are non-toxic to plant and mammalian cells, and interest in using them for biotechnological and medicinal purposes is growing. The goal of this project is to gain an insight into structure, dynamics, and the mechanism of action of defensins from Pinus sylvestris.

At UNC Charlotte his efforts will be focused on the development of novel optical wave-guide and fiber devices for passive and active mid-IR applications. Dr. Aggarwal recently retired as Head of the Optical Materials and Devices Branch at NRL after 25 years of government service. Previously he worked at several companies including Corning and Lasertron Inc. He was a senior scientist at Corning responsible for glass and fiber research and development and did some of the pioneering work in the beginning days of fiber-optics development in the 1970\u2019s. At Lasertron he worked as a Vice President responsible for development and engineering operations of semiconductor Lasers and corresponding Electronic Devices. Dr. Aggarwal received his Master\u2019s and Ph.D. degrees from Catholic University of America. Dr. Aggarwal together with his team at Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) pioneered the development, applications and commercialization of infrared (IR) transmitting optical materials; (i) low loss IR transmitting glass optical fibers and (ii) rugged transparent ceramic spinel windows. He directed the research programs to solve the various technical and engineering issues and successfully transitioned the enabling technologies, along with 17 patents, to the industrial sector. These materials are now commercially available and are improving the performance of existing applications as well as enabling new applications which were not previously possible. The combined market impact for these materials is estimated to be in the billions of dollars. The specific details are highlighted below: The first company to bring this IR fiber technology to market was CorActive who licensed the IR fiber technology developed by Dr. Aggarwal and his co-workers at NRL. Several companies, including BAE Systems, Raytheon and ITT are utilizing the IR fibers in their infrared countermeasure (IRCM) systems to protect aircraft from shoulder launched IR guided missiles, called MANPADS (man-portable air defense systems). The IR fiber solution is an optical engineering success story since it enables relocation of the laser in a remote location and use of multiple jam heads with one laser, resulting in huge cost savings, enhanced agility, low weight, small size, robustness and reliability. In addition to IRCM, there are many other applications for IR Fibers. Some examples include remote fiber based sensors using infrared spectroscopy for real-time in-situ environmental pollution monitoring and facility clean up, biomedical tissue analysis/diagnostics and laser surgery. The high brightness IR emission from their rare earth doped fibers, including mid-IR fiber lasers, will enable tailored IR sources for remote spectroscopy. These fibers also have the potential to revolutionize next generation compact fiber amplifiers and enhance telecom bandwidths. The highly non-linear chalcogenide fibers are enabling bright sources and lasers (Raman lasers, broadband supercontinuum sources, and parametric frequency shifters) in the infrared wavelengths using less than one meter length of fiber which can\u2019t be done with conventional silica fibers. These so called active fibers\u201d may replace existing bulky OPO and gas laser systems used for sensor systems. Dr. Aggarwal also helped develop additional IR fiber products which include hollow core photonic band gap (PBG) fibers, as well as photonic crystal fibers (PCF). Polycrystalline ceramic magnesium aluminate i. e. spinel (MgAl2O4) is a rugged, hard and strong material, just like sapphire. It optically transmits wavelengths all the way from UV to the mid IR (0.19 \u2013 5 \u00b5m). However, high optical quality spinel ceramic was not available prior to NRL inventions. Dr. Aggarwal at NRL pioneered the key technological developments to solve various issues relating to transparency and strength. The major application for spinel ceramic is in transparent armor. High energy laser windows, missile domes, optics for IR sensors. MER Corp. licensed the spinel technology, along with 6 patents, to manufacture spinel for commercial and military applications. Dr. Aggarwal and his co-worker Dr. Sanghera were recognized nationally. They were the recipients of the highly prestigious Federal Laboratories Consortium (FLC), National Award for Excellence in Technology Transfer in May 2008. They also received the Mid-Atlantic Regional Award for Excellence in Technology Transfer in October 2007. Dr. Aggarwal\u2019s numerous awards include a Sigma Xi Award in 1998; several NRL Alan Berman Publication Awards; a number of Thomas Edison patent awards and many NRL outstanding performance awards. Dr. Aggarwal, along with Dr. Sanghera, has been selected to receive the 2011 David Richardson Medal from the Optical Society of America (OSA). They are recognized for their pioneering work leading to the development, production and commercialization of Infrared Fiber and Transparent Ceramics resulting in numerous IR products.\u201d Dr. Aggarwal has transitioned four technologies to industry, published over 300 papers, edited 3 books and co-authored more than 70+ patents.

Astratov is a professor of Physics and Optical Science at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte. In 1986, he received his Ph.D. degree from the A.F. Ioffe Physical-Technical Institute in Russia. In this institute, he had accomplished a career as a research scientist, rising through the ranks from staff member (1981-1992), group leader (1992-1997), to senior member of staff in 1997. In the mid-90s, he pioneered studies of synthetic opals as novel self-assembled photonic crystals for visible light in his group at the Ioffe Institute. In 1997-2001, he was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Sheffield where he developed novel surface coupling techniques for studying photonic crystal waveguides and semiconductor microcavities. Since joining UNC-Charlotte in 2002, his research was devoted to microspherical photonics including super-resolution microscopy, resonant light forces, photonic nanojets, and photonic molecules. In his group, he developed the methods of super-resolution imaging based on using high-index dielectric microspheres immersed in liquids or in elastomeric slabs. These methods are widely used for imaging subcellular structures, viruses, and nanoplasmonic structures. He was a topical editor for the journal Optics Express in 2005-2011 and a program committee member for major international conferences including CLEO 2006-07 and 2012\u201315, IEEE Photonics 2014-17, OSA Advanced Photonics Congress 2016-17, Photonics West 2017-18, ICTON 2017-18 and OECC/ACOFT 2008 and 2014.

His research examines theU.S. Supreme Courtand Courts of Appeals, U.S. state courts of last resort, and theSupreme Court of Canada. Generally, he has focused on two central questions: the role that information plays in judicial decision making and the effects of diversity on the judicial process. Within these frameworks, he has explored a variety of topics, including party capability, attorney expertise and gender, judge gender and race, judicial efficiency, judicial selection, majority opinion assignment, and judicial dissensus. He has published more than two dozen publications in a variety of outlets, including Political Research Quarterly,Law & Society Review, Journal of Law & Courts, American Politics Research,Politics & Gender,Journal of Public Administration Research & Theory,Social Science Quarterly, Politics, Groups & Identities, and the Marquette Law Review. Dr. Szmer\u2019s UVA Press book, coauthored with Jennifer Barnes Bowie and the late Donald Songer, The View from the Bench and Chambers: Examining Judicial Process and Decision Making on the U.S. Courts of Appealsexamines the U.S. Courts of appeals using a mixed methods approach, combining more than sixty interviews with appellate judges and clerks with a variety of statistical analyses. Dr Szmer was a co-principal investigator on a National Science Foundation research grant, Collaborative Research: Judicial Diversity and Appellate Decision Making\u201d, examining the impact of the Obama appointees to the U.S. Courts of Appeals, focusing primarily on the influence of gender diversity. He is also currently working on a co-authored book manuscript, Courting Diversity: How Race & Gender Matter from Bar to Bench (under contract with Cambridge University Press). The study explores how institutional structures and rules condition the effects of race and gender diversity on the judicial process. In addition to his research, Dr. Szmer teaches a variety of courses at UNC Charlotte, including judicial process, judicial politics, constitutional law, gender and the law, quantitative methods (for undergraduates and Ph.D. students), and the introduction to American politics.

A simple but powerful assumption provides the foundation for my research: people create what they experience through the goals and beliefs that drive their behavior. As a social psychologist, I draw from the close relationships literature and use a combination of methodological approaches to explain the very basic, but often overlooked issue of how people\u2019s intentions toward others affect their relationships and the consequences of these processes for the self and others. I examine these processes across various types of relationships, including in roommates, friends, coworkers, married and dating couples, and in interactions between strangers and acquaintances. My program of work shows that people\u2019s goals or intentions toward others have powerful consequences for close relationships and personal well-being. When people have compassionate goals to support others, they and their relationships flourish: they give to others and others reciprocate, leading to better relationships and enhanced personal well-being for both people. People with self-image goals to manipulate others\u2019 views of the self focus on meeting their own needs and view others as a means to get what they want or need. As a result, they and their relationships function poorly: they give less and others reciprocate, leading to poor relationship functioning and diminished personal well-being for both people (Canevello & Crocker, 2010; 2011; Crocker & Canevello, 2008; Crocker, Canevello, Breines, & Flynn, 2010; Mischkowski, Crocker, Niiya, Canevello, & Moeller, under review). More recently, I have begun to examine the ways in which interpersonal goals shape responses to adversity, including approaches interpersonal problems, forgiveness following relationship transgressions, and personal growth following traumatic events. Broadly, my research attempts to answer big questions, such as:  When and how do we create upward and downward spirals in our relationships with others? How do we contribute to what others experience? What does it mean to have good relationships and how can we create them? What are the benefits of giving vs. receiving?  If you are interested becoming a research assistant in Dr. Canevello\u2019s lab: You should submit application materials the semester before you would like to join the lab. Applications for the Fall semester are accepted the previous spring; applications for the Spring semester are accepted the previous fall. Minimum requirements for these positions include: at least sophomore standing, a minimum 3.2 GPA (3.5 or higher is strongly preferred), previous research experience is a plus, and I rarely take people who have not completed the first research methods course (however, applications for outstanding students who do not meet one of these requirements may be considered). RAs work for research credit. I prefer that they take 3 hours, which translates to 12 hours per week in the lab, but I sometimes consider taking students for 2 credits (i.e., 9 hours per week). Generally, my team works between 9am and 5pm Monday through Friday (we sometimes extend those hours a bit). We don\u2019t typically work evenings or weekends, though again, we sometimes have to make exceptions. Specific schedules will depend on the kinds of data that we collect \u2013 if we\u2019re doing something with couples in the lab, it takes 2 RAs; running more simple procedures will only take one RA. But once we set a schedule, that will be the schedule. You would work the same hours every week and our weekly lab meeting would always be at the same time.

I define myself as a child clinical-community psychologist, and my primary professional interests focus on children and families. They include two main areas: (1) the development of children at-risk, in particular the examination of risk and resilience (i.e., effective coping and adaptation in the face of major life stress) and youngsters\u2019 adjustment to trauma; and (2) the use of evaluative research to guide system change, program refinement, service delivery, and policy. These interests drive my research, inform and complement my teaching, lead to opportunities for my students, and guide my service roles. Early in my training, I observed my mentors integrate research, service, and mentoring successfully. I resonated with the practical implications of community-based research and the critical need to conduct rigorous evaluations of community programs and initiatives. Indeed, I am drawn to my interest areas because they have real world\u201d relevance; I strive to make a heuristic contribution to the field and benefit my community. My other on-campus roles reflect these interests in drawing on our expertise here on campus to work with the community to address issues and promote the public good.

There is strong evidence that mental, physical and sexual health are linked and yet, because their interplay is complex, there are still many unknowns. Can inflammation be the common cause of sex differences in depression, heart disease and chronic pain? How does information about our social and sexual relationships change how our body interprets immune threats? How do psychological interventions change the fight-or-flight response to sexual behavior in women with a history of childhood sexual abuse? What causes antidepressant sexual side effects, and how does antidepressant use change neural activity during reproductive transitions (puberty, postpartum, or menopause)? To answer these and other questions, my work uses methods from multiple fields, including measures of hormones and immune markers, psychophysiological measures of sexual and autonomic arousal, neural imaging, clinical trials, surveys and interviews. One line of my research considers how the interaction of sexual behavior and immunity may influence women\u2019s mental and physical health. Across these studies we are finding that women\u2019s bodies respond differently to immune challenges if they are sexually abstinent vs. sexually active. We are now following up on that research, looking for the mechanisms by which sexual activity impacts immune function. Another line of this research is measuring the effects of childhood sexual abuse on interactions between the endocrine and autonomic nervous system response to stress in adult survivors, including how sexual abuse may influence women\u2019s immune responses to sexual activity. In the other direction, I examine how physical and mental health conditions impact women\u2019s sexual and relationship function. In this track, we are mapping out the etiology and treatment of antidepressant sexual side effects, and examining how treatment for gynecologic cancer influences women\u2019s ongoing sexual wellbeing.

He received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1981 in New Testament and Early Christian Literature. He previously held positions at the University of Notre Dame (1979-85) and the College of William and Mary (1985-89). His research interests have focused on the historical Jesus, Christian Origins, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and various forms of Judaism in the late 2nd Temple period. Tabor writes regularly for his popularTaborBlog here.He also has a Youtube channel featuring much of his work, including lectures and interviews here. Many of Dr. Tabor\u2019s articles and papers are archived here and can be downloaded as PDFs at no charge. His complete CV is here. Tabor is the author of ten books and numerous scholarly articles. His first book was a study of the mysticism of the apostle Paul titledThings Unutterable(1986), based on his University of Chicago dissertation. The prestigiousJournal of Religionnamed it one of the ten best scholarly studies on Paul of the 1980s. Tabor then turned to an analysis of attitudes toward religious suicide and martyrdom in the ancient world, the results of which appeared asA Noble Death, published by HarperCollins in 1992 (co-authored with Arthur Droge). Although the book centered on the history of such ideas in the ancient world, the results of this research have had immediate application in the contemporary discussion of the ethics of volunteer death and assisted suicide. It received an extensive essay review inChristian Century. During the 1993 Branch Davidian crisis in Waco, Texas, Tabor applied his expertise in interpreting biblically oriented apocalyptic worldviews to understanding the situation. As a result of his involvement Tabor publishedWhy Waco?Cults and the Battle for Religious Freedom in America(University of California Press, 1995), which he co-authored with Eugene Gallagher.Harper\u2019smagazine published a lengthy excerpt from the book (July, 1995). In 1995 Tabor testified before Congress as an expert witness on Waco. Tabor\u2019s 2006 book,The Jesus Dynasty:A New Historical Investigation of Jesus, His Royal Family, and the Birth of Christianity(Simon & Schuster, 2006), was aNew York Times Bestseller. Tabor presents the results of his work on the historical Jesus over the course of his career to a general audience. It has been translated into 25 languages and has become an international bestseller in the UK, Italy, Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands. In 2012 Tabor published two books: the first, co-authored with Simcha Jacobovici, The Jesus Discovery: The New Archaeological Find that Reveals the Birth of Christianity (Simon & Schuster) that offers a comprehensive overview of both of the Talpiot (Jesus family\u201d) tombs in Jerusalem with all the evidence brought together; and Paul and Jesus: How the Apostle Transformed Christianity (Simon & Schuster). Tabor has just published two new books, first,The Book of Genesis: A New Translation from the Transparent English Bible (Charlotte, NC: Genesis 2000, 2020), andPaul\u2019s Ascent to Paradise: The Apostolic Message and Mission of Paul in the Light of His Mystical Experiences (Charlotte, NC: Genesis 2000, 2020), both available in print and e-book via Amazon. He has just completed,The Lost Mary: From Jewish Mother of Jesus to Virgin Mother of God (forthcoming Knopf, 2023), but a French version is already available:Marie: De sonenhancejuice \u00e0 la foundation du christianisme(Paris: Flammarion, 2020). Over the past two decades Tabor has combined his work on ancient texts with field work in archaeology. He has worked at a number of sites in Israel and Jordan including Qumran, site of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1991, 1996), Wadi el-Yabis in Jordan (1992, 1996), Masada (1994), and Sepphoris (1996, 1999, 2000). In 2000 he teamed up with Dr. Shimon Gibson to excavate a newly discovered cave at Suba, west of Jerusalem that dates back to the Iron Age but was used for ritual rites in the early Roman period (2000-2006). Tabor and Gibson were also the principals involved in the discovery a 1st century Jewish burial shroud in a looted tomb at Akeldama. Their latest project is an ongoing excavation in Jerusalem onMt. Zionjust outside Mt Zion Gate along the Turkish city wall (2006-2018). Tabor is a popular public lecturer and writer and is often consulted by the national and international media (Time, Newsweek, USNews&World Report (cover story), NYTimes, LATimes, WashPost, Wall St. Journal, Harpers, Vanity Fair, AP, NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, Der Spiegel,Profil, The London Times). He is a regular blogger at the Huffington Post and does lectures, blog posts, and articles for the Biblical Archaeology Society.His work has been featured in dozens of TV documentaries (PBS Frontline, Discovery Channel,Nightline, 20/20, Learning Channel, History Channel, National Geographic,Smithsonian, BBC, Channel 4 UK, ZDF).

Research My research focuses on the overlap and equivalence between religion and sexuality. Specifically, I am interested in how religious, erotic and aesthetic experiences and practices foster a disruption of the subject\u2019s coherence in a way that can respond to, and perhaps prevent, various forms of cultural violence.In pursuing these questions, I am guided bythe work of Georges Bataille, psychoanalysis and queer theory. In Ecce Homo, my first book, I considered constructions of masculine subjectivity and the evocation of homoerotic desire in relation to representations of the male-body-in-pain, including psychoanalytic discourses, images of crucifixion, paintings by Francis Bacon, photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe and films from the Hollywood action genre. InConstraining Violence, my current project, I extend this consideration by staging a conversation among Leo Bersani, Jean Laplanche, Bataille, and Lee Edelman to sketch the kinds of ethical frameworks and political analyses that might be generated by focusing on negativity, self-annihilation and the death drive. InFormalizing Desire, my next project, I will explore these same questions from the vantage point of mystical and pornographic writing, their shared stylistic and formal features, and their capacity to disrupt the reader\u2019s sense of a stable, coherent self.These questions will bepursued through comparative analyses of the Marquis de Sade and Hadewijch of Antwerp, Georges Bataille and Angela of Foligno, Jean Genet and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux, and Dennis Cooper and Pseudo-Dionysius.

Second, I am interested in how religion both enables and constrains our conceptions of the world. Third, I am fascinated by how religion itself is defined\u2014by academics, journalists, and practitioners\u2014and how such definitions work in social and cultural arenas to mark\u201d the status of different individuals and groups.

B. Sherman (B.A., Stanford University; M.A., University of California, Los Angeles; Ph.D., Stanford University) joined the UNC Charlotte faculty in fall of 2017. His research approaches the history and literature of Muslim societies with a particular focus upon premodern South and Central Asia. His research engages the imagination of language and revelation in premodern Islamic culture. When does language become revelation? And how does the presence of new\u201d revelation transform the emergence of categories such as tribe, ethnicity, and race in the broader Islamic world? In addition to his interests in the linguistic imagination of Islamic literatures, he also researches and teaches on issues of apocalypticism, hagiography, theory and method in the study of religion, missionary movements in South Asia, and Islam in America. His current project is provisionally titled Mountains and Messiahs, and it focuses upon a Sufi millenarian movement popular among Afghan communities between Peshawar and Kabul in the 17th century. In narrating this story of a particular Sufi movement, however, this project explores a much larger topic: the ideologies and imaginations of letters, words, and revelation across the late medieval and early modern Islamic world. This project is a multidisciplinary project, connecting Pashto and Persian manuscripts to contemporary literary theory and philosophies of semiosis and subjectivity.

Her research efforts revolve around the central question of stratification research including who gets what and why do they get it? In her research, she has used this essential question to gain a better understanding of her substantive areas of education and race and ethnicity. In general, she investigates how inequality, particularly racial and ethnic inequality, is generated and sustained in the American educational system. Recently, her work has focused on gender and racial inequalities in higher education, particularly with regard to college majors.

My name is Justin Cary and I am a Lecturer in the Writing, Rhetoric, and Digital Studies Department at UNC Charlotte. I have been teaching for almost ten years now and I have been at UNC Charlotte since 2011.I really love the work I do; both as a teacher and as a member of an exciting new Department. I believe in the real world potential for writing and what it can do; that helping students better understand tools at their disposal (such as rhetoric, visual literacies, inquiry and critical self-reflection) will ultimately help them apply those tools for success during college and beyond.  Writing works; it can do things. Writing is real and it has real world applications in every profession. From a teaching standpoint, I use a wide variety of techniques to help students practice and apply writing. From integrating social media platforms into writing projects to opening up the course and allowing students to inquire into topics they feel passionate about, my teaching practice is always developing and always evolving. Most recently, my work has revolved around Digital Rhetoric; the study of evolving rhetorical strategies and technique and the role those strategies and techniques play in cutting edge writing situations. For example, I have been studying the potential for hybridizing digital texts into part digital part analogue compositions using digital composition and 3D printing. I also love video games! I have been playing them since I was a little kid and from time to time I bring these works of art and composition into the class so we can see how writing, rhetoric and composition function in these digital spaces.  In many of my courses we use Podcasting as our primary composing medium; here\u2019s why.  Currently, I am teaching UWRT 1104; the hybrid, First-Year Writing course taught by WRDS faculty. I am also teaching LBST 2301; a Critical Thinking and Communications course that focuses on the rhetoric of online gaming communities and how folks use writing to convey complex messages across platforms such as Twitch.

The role of school disengagement is also assessed, measuring unexcused absences that follow suspensions in the previous academic year.Our findings suggest that addressing the school-to-prison pipeline will require focus on more than individual-level behaviors (school disengagement and school-based offenses) and attention to the impact of extra-legal variables and systemic implicit bias. Status: In Press (Journal of Social Service Research)     Does rejection sensitivity affect the severity of substance abuse? Evidence from North Carolina(Christie Nelson, Kailas Venkitasubramanian) Rejection sensitivity (RS) is cognitive-affective processing disposition that undermines how one relates to the world. Prior rejection experiences are hypothesized to lead people to form insecure working models of relationships that set the stage for how they behave in their subsequent relationships and orientation to the world. RS has been correlated to poor quality of adult attachment. Although attachment-related processes have been linked to both adult RS and adult problematic substance use, there is yet to be a determination of the link between RS and substance use in adults. We investigate this link.

I am still maintaining my UNCC research activities.    Education  Both my undergraduate and graduate degrees are from University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland.  Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering, July 1995    Doctorate (Ph.D.) in Mechanical Engineering, January 2002.   My Ph.D. was on the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of silicon oxide coated wafers. This project was funded by Intel, Ireland. The research involved looking at CMP process fundamentals such as temperature distributions, pressure distributions and pad wear. As part of my Ph.D. I was lucky enough to spend a year conducting experiments in both UC Berkeley, CA, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), MD.  Previous Ventures  After graduating with my engineering degree (1995) I worked for over a year with BOSE, Ireland (the loudspeaker people). There I supported production and was involved in new project introduction. After a year and a bit I went back to College to get my Ph.D. (see above). On completion of my Ph.D. I got an EU funded Marie Curie Fellowship position at Carl Zeiss in Oberckocken, Germany. Carl Zeiss make optical components for everything. I was there from March 2002 to March 2004. During that time I learned about traditional polishing, advanced finishing techniques, production considerations, metrology and most importantly how to speak German (sort of ish).  Present Day  I joined UNC Charlotte in August 2004 and am a tenured Professor within the Department of Mechanical Engineering.

Lee, Ph.D. Webpage   Bioheat and Mass Transfer Laboratory: Research: Currently we are working in a number of research areas related to Biomedical Engineering   Hypothermic machine perfusion preservation of livers for transplantation:  With over 15,000 patients waiting for liver transplantation and over 1100 deaths a year as a result of organ shortages, there is a need to improve preservation of livers and new ways to expand the donor pool. Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) has the potential to provide better quality livers for transplant and reclaim marginal organs that currently are unusable. Currently, HMP has not improved long-term storage (>24 hrs) of livers and our group is investigating the cause of damage. Three subprojects related to this work are: A. Determining the effect of shear stress at hypothermic temperatures on endothelial cells in the isolated livers. Our group is able to machine perfused a liver on a temperature controlled microscope stage and image the sinusoidal structure of the liver with intravital microscopy. B. Understand the effect of shear stress on endothelial cells in a microshear chamber at hypothermic temperatures. Using primary cultures of liver endothelial cells we are using video microscopy to assess endothelial cell shape as a function of shear stress. C. Investigate the potential of reclaiming non-heart-beating donor livers with machine perfusion. Donors that experience cardiac arrest prior to removal of their organs experience periods of warm ischemia which make the organs unusable. Our group has shown that machine perfusion has the potential to reclaim and preserve for short periods these organs for transplant. D. Investigate the potential in preserving fatty livers by HMP. E. Collaboration with Carolinas Medical Center Transplantation Group and Organ Recovery Systems to scale-up HMP livers for transplants.  Bioinstrumentation: Our group is finding that we need to build instruments for our research purposes and that these devices may have broader applications. We will continue to build such devices for diagnostics and imaging purposes.  Selected Publications:Pegg, D.E., Rubinsky, B., Diaper, M., Lee, C.Y.

The overall focus is improving the practicing engineer\u2019s ability to produce accurate components in a timely manner; this has important ramifications for both the private and defense sectors. Our approach is to perform fundamental research in support of this goal, while taking care to consider the practical implementation of our research efforts. Through this combined agenda, students from the high school to graduate levels are trained to have strong analytical/numerical modeling capabilities coupled withfundamental experimental techniques and data analysis skills.  Dr. Schmitz prepares a milling test.  While the historical focus of manufacturing research has been at the macro-scale, recent technological innovations have led to new research activities at both the micro- and nano-scales. This multi-scale manufacturing approach mirrors the current climate within the manufacturing industry which demands expertise at all length scales. We also recognize that manufacturing in the 21st  Displacement measuring interferometer setup  century requires knowledge in many areas, including structural dynamics, optics and photonics, precision design, heat transfer, uncertainty analysis,and metrology (the science of measurement), in order to develop process models and improve efficiency. An important example is the increased use of high-speed machining to produce discrete components in the aerospace, automotive, and biomedical industries from the micrometer to meter scales. This remains a cornerstone of our research efforts.
